By the time they reach old age, they have failed to learn anything.  \n> If you use proper technique to practice, you can actually count the days that it takes to improve.

Since I love it, specially on this video, I decided to try to follow the lyrics. And hey, I was actually able to understand a bit of the first verse, and the first 2 lines of the bridge. That’s so cool!\n\n\n> Du hast mich nie darum gebeten,  \n> ich weiß, ich weiß, ja ich weiß.  \n> Es tut dir leid, oder auch nicht,  \n> keine Ahnung, was weiß ich schon.  \n> Es war alles umsonst,  \n> Aber is' okay, es ist okay für mich.  \n>   \n> _you never asked me  \n> i know i know yes i know  \n> you're sorry or not  \n> no idea, what do I know.  \n> It was all in vain  \n> But it's okay, it's okay for me._\n\n\n> Denn du warst süß wie Honig in meinem Kaffee  \n> Präsent in meinem Kopf von früh bis spät.  \n> Viel zu spät hab ich gecheckt:  \n> Gäb's nen Wettbewerb für Idioten  \n> hätt' ich haushoch gewonnen.  \n>   \n> _'Cause you were sweet as honey in my coffee  \n> Present in my mind from dawn to dusk.  \n> I checked much too late:  \n> There's a competition for idiots  \n> I would have won hands down._\n\n"
