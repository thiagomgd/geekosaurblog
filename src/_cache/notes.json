That’s so cool!\n\n> Du hast mich nie darum gebeten,  \n>ich weiß, ich weiß, ja ich weiß.  \n>Es tut dir leid, oder auch nicht,  \n>keine Ahnung, was weiß ich schon.  \n>Es war alles umsonst,  \n>Aber is' okay, es ist okay für mich.  \n>  \n>_you never asked me  \n>i know i know yes i know  \n>you're sorry or not  \n>no idea, what do I know.  \n>It was all in vain  \n>But it's okay, it's okay for me._\n\n> Denn du warst süß wie Honig in meinem Kaffee  \n>Präsent in meinem Kopf von früh bis spät.  \n>Viel zu spät hab ich gecheckt:  \n>Gäb's nen Wettbewerb für Idioten  \n>hätt' ich haushoch gewonnen.  \n>  \n>_'Cause you were sweet as honey in my coffee  \n>Present in my mind from dawn to dusk.  \n>I checked much too late:  \n>There's a competition for idiots  \n>I would have won hands down._\n"
