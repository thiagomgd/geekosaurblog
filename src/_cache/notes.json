Since I don’t use Spotify anymore and have migrated to Youtube Music, I decided to recreate my playlists there.\n\nI never finished those playlists on Spotify, so I’ll see if someday I find the setlists so I can have complete playlists there. I also want to create setlist for other bands I’ve played with, and also my big band. But that’s for another time. They are both below:\n\n- [Trivial](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZIaVOUaxLAOpQvzJCeugpYgRpPlnA8m2&feature=share)\n\n- [The Mad Mavericks](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZIaVOUaxLAP7EK8JjXvc3FpWoM-LUVlI&feature=share)\n",

And I guess the most important thing is not using the main timeline, but instead relying on the lists feature.\n\nIt’s really a letdown that to have a good experience on the platform we should avoid the main user experience they are offering, but I guess that’s the only way of really avoiding so many suggestions, likes and topics.\n\nIt’s still doesn’t solve my gripe with having my likes to myself, but that’s maybe ok for now.\n\nThe article: [https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/](https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/)\n\nThis HackerNews comment (and following thread) also gives some indication that yeah, trying to mark those suggestions as ‘not interested’ is not gonna help in the long run, but just make Twitter suggest worse content every time [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30271837](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30271837) \n",

I’m really enjoying this app, as it gives you words based on the most used words in real life scenarios, instead of giving a dozen words from a different category each time.\n\nThe phrases are also more meaningful and realistic, so I’m probably keep using it to slowly build vocabulary, since I don’t have a lot of time and energy for more focused study and longer sessions.\n",

But I’m happy it’s here now. And it looks BEAUTIFUL!\n\nYou can see the trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgB7rMuxY-s) and listen to the soundtrack [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgJeWP_vw8M&list=PLuF78wm0RiGZlDiRBcCa06LCQLBC4T938).\n",
