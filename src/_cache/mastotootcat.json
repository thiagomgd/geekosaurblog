      "content": "<p>One of the things about using Obsidian to write my blog notes instead of Notion, is that it gets harder to do that on mobile - I use Obsidian-sync, not git.</p><p>So now I basically wanted something to simplify posting a journal/note to my blog, so I decided to go with Mastodon. Just finished doing a basic implementation to load toots and build the notes, as I already do with the md files. Let's see how it goes</p>",

Love this kind of \"we can't get out of here and monsters come at night\" type of story, and the setting and characters seem interesting.</p><p>Also nice that it's already been renewed for S2, which is starting late April - that's actually the reason I decided to start it</p>",
