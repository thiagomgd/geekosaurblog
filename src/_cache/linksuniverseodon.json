        "Haven't done it so far since I wanted something with an API and, although Bookwyrm has what I needed for my books page on my blog (they have a public json file with all your book), it missed too many titles from my import, and also seems it has a lot of duplicate (even triplicate) books.",
        "So, decided to go with Storygraph, even if that means my book page will have to wait until I update it to read from Storygraph's export."

        "Really glad to see \"When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace\" mentioned for voice acting. That scene was GREAT, and the VA did an amazing job in ONE take!",
        "This is an anime that was quickly forgotten, I think, but this scene remains. Still, I would love to see a season 2, or the light novel/manga being translated",
        "edit: waaaaittt. It's actually available in English? I might need to check this out"
