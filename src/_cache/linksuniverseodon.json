        "Really glad to see \"When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace\" mentioned for voice acting. That scene was GREAT, and the VA did an amazing job in ONE take!",
        "This is an anime that was quickly forgotten, I think, but this scene remains. Still, I would love to see a season 2, or the light novel/manga being translated",
