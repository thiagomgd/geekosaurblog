I‚Äôve read the first 39 or 49? Like, almost the first cycle. I really do wish to get back to it. Every time I watch/read some sci-fi with space-travel, I get reminded of it.

Along with Perry Rhodan, this one was also responsible for me going to sleep late quite a few nights.</p>\n<h3>3 - The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking) <a href=\"https://geekosaur.com/post/7-books-tag/#3-the-end-of-everything-astrophysically-speaking\">#</a>\n</h3>\n<p>This is an absolute must read if you have any interest in astronomy, astrophysics, or just the space in general. Even though it‚Äôs astrophysics, the book is laid out in a way that‚Äôs very easy to understand, while still going deep enough to be very relevant. 11 out of 10, with a gold start sticker on it. <em>Also go follow the author, Katie Mack, online (</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AstroKatie\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>)</em>.</p>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://geekosaur.com/img/chZOTYh-8a-500.jpeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" /><h3>4 - House Of Secrets <a href=\"https://geekosaur.com/post/7-books-tag/#4-house-of-secrets\">#</a>\n</h3>\n<p>Besides Harry Potter and Twilight, this is a series that I share a connection with my mother. She read the first 2 books right after me, but then the 3rd one was taking too long to come out in Portuguese, so I ended up getting it in English on my Kindle. But then after it was released, of course I had to get it for her.</p>\n<h3>5 - Furiously Happy: A Funny Book About Horrible Things <a href=\"https://geekosaur.com/post/7-books-tag/#5-furiously-happy-a-funny-book-about-horrible-things\">#</a>\n</h3>\n<p>I was never a big non-fiction reader, but this was a book that kinda changed my perception about memoirs. It‚Äôs SO fun, heartwarming AND heartbreaking at times, Jenny Lawson is just too great of a writer.</p>\n<h3>6 - The Hound of the Baskervilles (or all Sherlock Holmes books?) <a href=\"https://geekosaur.com/post/7-books-tag/#6-the-hound-of-the-baskervilles-or-all-sherlock-holmes-books\">#</a>\n</h3>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes was a huge for me when I was younger. I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of it at some point. It definitely made me fall even more in love with mysteries, and this is one that not only was fun, but I do remember grabbing it at the bookstore when I was a ‚Äúkid‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Bonus here: I also like The Boscombe Valley Mystery a lot.</p>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://geekosaur.com/img/9F2W8QLHVT-1200.jpeg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" alt=\"\" />This was the cover of the version I have back home.

Even though we didn‚Äôt talk much about it, but some time after that I came to Canada, and she passed away a year and a half later üòï</p>\n<p>I ended up reading book 4 (or 4 and 5) in 2018 while I was in Toronto, but only actually got back to the series this year.
