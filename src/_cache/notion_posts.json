Let’s start with Can't Get You out of My Head by Kylie Minogue, which they recorded along with another band called Parcels.\n\n[bookmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RacxNskxySo)\n\nIf you are ancient like me, you probably are familiar with Tom’s Diner. If you don’t remember it by the name, the first 1 second might be enough to make you remember. Played with Giant Rooks\n\n[bookmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r3B7yz6J68)\n\nSomething a bit newer: Valerie, played with Natalie Findlay and featuring a sweet flugelhorn solo!\n\n[bookmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm-FH82lVbE)\n\nCome Together is a classic, right?\n\n[bookmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkP7QWsfNc0)\n\nAnd let’s end up with one that’s not a cover :)\n\n[bookmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8WJYwFlyUg)\n"
