      "title": "Manga Reading: Mid-Year Check",
      "content": "\nJust doing a quick check on what I’ve read so far this year in terms on manga and comics! \n\n\nAccording to my stats - as you can see below - I’ve hit 100 volumes so far! And this is probably still missing a few volumes that don’t have the date set, or which I read chapters on Shonen Jump but didn’t add the corresponding volumes because I either forgot, or it is not listed on GoodReads yet. I’ll check those later on.\n\n\n![Much reading, such manga. WOW](/img/notion/cef1d8a6-4b41-4e1e-a1ea-8723a3e570bd/dA6hvAPSFe-781.jpeg)\n\n\nLet’s start with what’s right here on the screenshot: One Piece! This year I finally went ahead and decided to start reading One Piece again. I first started it many years ago back in Brazil (I guess like… 20 years ago?), but stopped when the publisher stopped, and only tried restarting it again at some point like 7 or 8 years ago.\n\n\nNow I’m just 1 chapter shy of finishing volume 70 - chapter 700! It’s great that everything is available on the Shonen Jump app and I don’t even have to go to the library to pick more volumes.\n\n\nAlso, I’ve been wanting to get a tattoo (or some), and I think I probably going to get a Chopper :) \n\n\nNext I have Sakamoto Days and Kaiju No 8. Both were kinda binged up to chapter 54. For Kaiju No 8 I actually read it in just 1 day. In both cases, it seemed like a good place to stop, and wait a bit for them to wrap the story arcs that were starting there. I should be reading more Sakamoto Days soon.\n\n\n![](/img/notion/cef1d8a6-4b41-4e1e-a1ea-8723a3e570bd/PVQ222k_P8-399.jpeg)\n\n\n![](/img/notion/cef1d8a6-4b41-4e1e-a1ea-8723a3e570bd/PVevMoh318-426.jpeg)\n\n\nMieruko-chan I’m basically reading as they release the volumes, and I read the latest Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid volume available. Have to read the spin-offs at some point!\n\n\nGal Gohan is a manga that I’ve seen recommended a few times, specially for those interested in a Gal manga, and decided to read it. It’s pretty fun, although focuses on fanservice, so beware :) \n\n\n![](/img/notion/cef1d8a6-4b41-4e1e-a1ea-8723a3e570bd/GW__DXdZdU-512.jpeg)\n\n\nAnd for last, I’ve read a volume of GTO: Paradise Lost and also The Sacred Blacksmith as they were available on Kindle Unlimited, and I was in the trial. Also read the first half of The Woods with that trial (the latter volumes were not included, but I still wanna read them at some point)\n\n\n![](/img/notion/cef1d8a6-4b41-4e1e-a1ea-8723a3e570bd/nyHqZitqWr-514.jpeg)\n\n\nI also read One Punch Man and some newer Spy x Family chapters, but I still need to add the volumes to GoodReads. If you wanna check my read list at any point, it’s all here on the blog ([link](https://geekosaur.com/comics-manga-read/)), and you can also add me on GoodReads ([Falcon](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22638412-falcon)) and AniList ([FalconSensei](https://anilist.co/user/FalconSensei/))\n\n"

      "title": "April Reading Wrap Up And May Plans",
      "content": "\nLast month I shared my plans for the month: 1 fiction and 2 non-fiction books, and manga ([check it here](https://geekosaur.com/post/reading-plans-april-2022/)). \n\n\nUnfortunately, I ended up not reading as much of the books. About 70-ish pages of one of the non-fiction books (The Courage To Be Disliked) and a bit over half of Death Masks.\n\n\nI did read 302 chapters of One Piece - right at the end of the Slypiea arc, so it wasn’t like I wasn’t reading. Just read way more manga than planned.\n\n\nAlso, I ended up taking driving lessons, got a mirrorless camera (Sony a6400) and went out a few times to take pictures and all and also had friends’ birthdays two weekends in a row. So it was a good month, just less book reading than planning - and less studying German, which I’m hoping to correct now.\n\n\nSo I guess for May plans: finish those 3 books - Death Masks should be finished tonight, and decide on another fiction book to read. And, try to actually read more this month, watch less TV and waste less time on the computer in general - apart from studying German, photography and useful stuff.\n\n\n![](/img/notion/43dadffe-557d-492e-8087-5c1ee578a524/K-nT-SdCsV-619.jpeg)\n\n\nThumbnail by [Christin Hume](https://unsplash.com/@christinhumephoto?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/reading?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)\n\n"

They are:\n\n- Netflix loses subscribers for the first time in 10+ years ([article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/19/netflix-nflx-earnings-q1-2022.html), [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31088353));\n- Netflix shares drop 26% after it loses 200K subscribers ([article](https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-50face93d2d2a876fa5485500e3d360a), [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31089802))\n- Netflix to introduce ad-supported plan (article, HN discussion)\n- Netflix hints at password sharing crackdown as subscribers fall ([article](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61153252), [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31095078))\n\nNow, pairing those news with ‘older’ news and online discussions and complaints I see from time to time, I guess a lot of dissatisfaction if justified here, to an extent.\n\n\n## Password Sharing\n\n\nLet me start by saying: password sharing is wrong. But we do need to think about why some people do it, and maybe what could be done to improve the situation, along with recognizing that this is probably not going away completely. If password sharing is completely impossible, people will probably revert back to pirating.\n\n\nSome reasons why we password share: the most obvious, it’s cheaper to pay for the 4 screen plan than for 4x1 screen plan. Second, many people justify it because they don’t watch it that much - so it’s kind of a problem with the catalog. And the third reason, that I think justifies the whole thing, is that to get 4k video, you basically need to pay for the package with 4 screens. In my house, it’s just me and my wife, we don’t watch much, and never watch concurrently. So yeah... not going to pay the most expensive package with 4 screens for our usage. But I also refuse to not have good quality video and audio.\n\n\n## Content\n\n"

I defined goals for books (fiction and non-fiction) and also manga (not a ‘goal’ though, since I didn’t specify how many chapters).\n\n\nAny way, most of my reading this month so far has been for manga: I’ve read 240 chapters of One Piece! I’m currently in the Skypiea arc, but it’s probably time to start taking it easy, unless I want to miserably fail at my book goals, haha.\n\n\nBut it was not a bad month so far, I was just busier and with less energy for books, as I mentioned in the [last Geekosaur News](https://geekosaur.com/post/geekosaur-news-23/). Also, I wasn’t planning on getting involved in photography, and investigating which camera and lens to get, trying to find it - and then going out for photo walks - takes time, but was very enjoyable.\n\n\nThis is how much I read on the past couple weeks\n\n\n![](/img/notion/995e6d0d-6198-4568-917a-cb1127e96ad8/RFbw1Zb5rS-614.jpeg)\n\n\nI think it’s alright everything considered. But I’ll make some effort for the rest of the month!\n\n\n_Social Media Thumbnail by_ [_Sonja Punz_](https://unsplash.com/@sonnnchen?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) _on_ [_Unsplash_](https://unsplash.com/collections/QUlPu1EDJjE/reading?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)\n\n"

      "title": "Geekosaur News 23: Getting Older Is Tough, I Guess?",
      "content": "\n_Currently Reading: One Piece, Death Masks (The Dresden Files #5)\nCurrently Watching: Bob’s Burgers_\n\n\nAnother week went by, and it went so fast. I had a 4 day weekend, but didn’t accomplish many of my ‘goals’, but at least I got to relax and go out with my wife to take pictures with our new camera and lenses.\n\n\n**Getting older is tough**: I don’t know if it’s just the age showing, or what, but I used to be way more into ‘deeper’/’slower’ TV shows and books, but nowadays I’m basically watching Bob’s Burgers  and reading One Piece and urban fantasy because anything else is just too much.\n\n\nToo much to think about, too much energy to spend, but I guess too much commitment, I guess. I mean, a cartoon episode is 20 min long, and I can actually just watch half of it and leave the rest to continue later on, without any issues. Manga is also easy to read a little bit and stop any time, since chapters are usually short. \n\n\nI still binge things like Servant and Severance with my wife, but I used to complement those with other TV shows that, even if they were not anything deep, but at least 45 min long. Now seems that is too much of a commitment.\n\n\nIs this a result of getting older and general lack of energy and desire to engage in things? A bit of depression kicking in occasionally? Let’s see how it goes, so far it’s something that comes and goes.\n\n\n**Anime**: I tried Crunchyroll to see if this time I would enjoy Love is War - I watched half of the first episode when the first season came out. But my TV doesn’t have Crunchyroll’s app, and their AirPlay doesn’t work? At least on my TV? So I guess for now I’ll try to decide on a live TV show, haha. Or maybe watch the cartoon version of The Boys, or the Critical Role show.\n\n\n**Photography**: I got a Sony a6400 with 2 kit lenses, and also bought a Sigma 30mm F1.4. My wife wanted a camera for a long time, and I also have some interest in photography, so we ended up getting that. We already went out like 3 times to take pics, and so far we are enjoying it a lot. It’s awesome to have an excuse to go out and explore! We created an Instagram account for it: [@sugarcoast_pics](https://www.instagram.com/sugarcoast_pics/). We are going to slowly post things there, and I’ll also share things on my Twitter on [this photography thread](https://twitter.com/FalconSensei/status/1515549868357406727).\n\n\n![Taken with the Sigma 30mm - No edits, I swear!](/img/notion/cf598040-f5a3-4b9d-ac29-8dccc886f3e1/_AMxTsR-H7-1200.jpeg)\n\n\n**Wrapping Up!**\n\n\nLet’s see how this week goes for me. I’ll try to take and share more pics - and try to learn how to take better pics and how to properly use the camera - and also will focus again on learning German, and try to read some non-fiction book like I had planned for April ([shared on this post](https://geekosaur.com/post/reading-plans-april-2022/)). For now, getting back to playing trumpet will need to wait a bit. I’ll focus on those other things + exercising to see if I’ll have more energy going forward.\n\n\n_Social media thumbnail by_ [_Mathyas Kurmann_](https://unsplash.com/@mathyaskurmann?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) _on_ [_Unsplash_](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/newsletter?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)_._\n\n"

How I Met Your Father is not so good, but just alright to watch when having lunch, since I’m a bit tired of Golden Girls.\n\n\nI just got a Sony a6400, and now I started following some people on Instagram and Twitter that have the same camera (or any other in the a6xxx family). Of course, also joined [r/sonyalpha](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/)\n\n\n## News/Thoughts\n\n\n**Twitter** is working on an edit button. I know is a very requested feature for a long time, and I also kinda want it, but I see this going wrong in so many ways...\n\n1. Retweets are gonna be tricky if I’m not notified that something I RTd was updated\n2. Since my likes are advertised to everyone that follows me, that’s also a problem\n3. Of course someone will try to sell viral tweets at some point\n\nAmy Schumer said she was going to take a month off from comedy following Will Smith’s slap because ‘that was too traumatizing’. And then she revealed that they didn’t let her make a joke about Alec Baldwin’s onset killing - the prop gun that was loaded with real ammo and ended up killing someone ([twitter link](https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1511029832611778564)). I’m still trying to understand how the slap was too much, but an actual killing is so chill that she can joke about that.\n\n\nAlso discovered that she’s going to be in the next season of Only Murders In The Building, and now I’m worrying about it being any good. The first season was AMAZING, but whyyyyy.\n\n\n![](/img/notion/5568e72a-9aba-459b-8d06-a8762aef5cc0/ySF6VD7Kml-600.jpeg)\n\n\n**Blizzard** removed the letter Z on the skins of Zarya, Overwatch’s Russian hero ([twitter](https://twitter.com/Polygon/status/1511802982576406529)). Not that this makes us forget the [Hong Kong incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzchung_controversy#:~:text=In%20October%202019%2C%20American%20video,during%20an%20official%20streaming%20event.), and sexual abuse lawsuit. After all, Blizzards changed one of Tracer’s victory poses because it was ‘too sexualizing’, and then we discovered all sexual harassment and sexism in the company. Now they are only doing this because maybe they don’t care much about Russia anyway, since if China was doing anything wrong, they would bend or get on their knees as requested.\n\n\n## Fun/Cool Stuff\n\n\nI recommended Katie Mack’s twitter here recently, so let’s go with something that also applies to software development. Just change the minus signal to a ; or ,\n\n\n[textTweet](https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/1511760122120339460)\n\n"

      "content": "\nI think posting my reading goals for this month might be a good way of keeping my focus, and might do that every month - I hope - and also try that for movies and TV shows. Let’s see!\n\n\n## Books\n\n\n### Non-Fiction\n\n\nFor non-fiction, there are 2 books I wanna read. And I’m probably going to only have time to actually finish 1, and start the other.\n\n\nOne of them I ordered this Friday, and should be arriving tomorrow. It’s Courage To Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga. I never read Self Help books, but this sounds interesting and I really wanna give it a try. There’s a video review on Youtube, by Ali Abdaal ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf4Hs5E9eNg)).\n\n\nThe other one is a science book I got last year: The End of Everything (Astrophisically Speaking) by Katie Mack. I always wanted to read more about space and astrophysics, and this one sounds so good. Also, be sure to [follow Katie on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AstroKatie), it’s great!\n\n\n[bookmark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked)\n\n\n[bookmark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52767659-the-end-of-everything)\n\n\n### Fiction\n\n\nI’m “currently reading” Strange Weather In Tokyo, but I think I need something more adventure, fun and relaxing, specially since I’m going to try to read some non-fiction, and want to try ramping up on my German learning. So I’m going with Death Masks (The Dresden Files #5) by Jim Butcher. This is a highly entertaining Urban Fantasy series, with lots of action, some fun scenes and cool plot and world.\n\n\n[bookmark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91479.Death_Masks)\n\n\n[bookmark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18283207-strange-weather-in-tokyo)\n\n\n## Manga\n\n\nRecently I started reading One Piece again. I read some of it - about 20, 21 volumes - when it first started being published in Brazil, but distribution in my area was horrible, I ended up missing a volume or two, and then the publisher went under so... I tried again years later (still like 10 years ago), but at that time, I was not up for the commitment. After #ONEPIECE1044 was trending on Twitter, I decided to finally give it another try. So that’s what I’ll be reading in April.\n\n\nI’ll also be either continuing reading Black Clover - I read about 180 chapters on 2020, while I was “stranded” at my parent’s place in Brazil because of the pandemic - and maybe now it’s time to continue it. OR, I’m going to be starting My Hero Academia manga, since I’m a big fan of the anime.\n\n\nOne Punch Man is going to be paused for a while probably.\n\n"

      "title": "AppleTV+: Quality Over Quantity",
      "content": "\nAs a result from CODA getting 3 Oscars this weekend, AppleTV+ is getting even more positive attention, and that’s great!\n\n\nI think their general approach to quality over quantity is awesome, and the fact that they are not outright cancelling all their shows is even better. Of course not everything is a big hit, but overall I would say that their balance of good vs crap content is way better than others.\n\n\n> Apple TV+ has more than 250 wins in award ceremonies and almost 1,000 nominations over its two years of existence. ([9to5mac](https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/29/wsj-apple-tv-praised-by-quality-over-quantity-nearly-doubled-its-revenue-in-2021/))\n\n\nWhile they do have a limited catalog, I have to say that Dickinson, Ted Lasso, Servant and Central Park are amazing, and they have so many interesting shows, that you sure are going to find something for you!\n\n\n![](/img/notion/1d1604cd-6cd2-41dc-88a3-d3f7a9f4b51c/JH32FFpHVS-480.gif)\n\n\nAlready Watched and Currently Watching:\n\n- Dickinson: period drama about Emily Dickinson. Made me fall in love with poetry, like Penny Dreadful did too;\n- Ted Lasso: I’m not a fan of sports and soccer, but OMG I binged the first season so hard and was so excited when the 2nd came out. Now I’m here just waiting for S3 - the last one - to come out and see those characters again.\n- Servant: M. Night Shyamalan! Wonderful show so far, watched the first 2 seasons, and loved the 2nd even more than the first. The 3rd is currently being released, and I should be watching it soon!\n- Amazing Stories: cool remake of the old series - or is it new stories? IDK, but it’s short, fun, with each episode being a different sci-fi/fantasy story. Neat!\n- Central Park: animated musical comedy! It’s so much fun, has good jokes and great music.\n- Schmigadoon!: musical based on Brigadoon, a 50s musical. It’s nice, short, great to relax at night.\n\n\t![](/img/notion/1d1604cd-6cd2-41dc-88a3-d3f7a9f4b51c/aNe5GZuPSp-600.gif)\n\n\nTo Watch:\n\n- Pachinko: The original book is in my TBR list, but this adaptation, looks FANTASTIC! I’m going to start watching it this weekend!\n- CODA: _duh._ JK, it has actually been in my list since forever, but I never take time to watch movies. That should be remedied. The main actress is from Locke & Key, and it’s a movie about music so... I’m gonna watch it!\n- The Essex Serpent: victorian era drama that sounds promising. Not released yet though.\n- Home Before Dark: mystery show that sound very interesting, and has a young girl as protagonist/person investigating. Why not give it a try?\n- The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey: Samuel L. Jackson in a mystery/drama show? I’m in.\n- Acapulco: I actually watched the first episode, and thought it was nice. But paused because there was so much going on and I didn’t want to watch that much TV. But it’s fun and I should be watching the rest as time allows me.\n\n[bookmark](https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/29/wsj-apple-tv-praised-by-quality-over-quantity-nearly-doubled-its-revenue-in-2021/)\n\n\n[bookmark](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-quality-over-quantity-approach-pays-off-at-oscars-11648499685)\n\n"

This is my favorite anime of all time, holds a place dear to my heart, and I absolutely adore Belldandy and Keiichi and Belldandy as a couple.\n\n\n![](/img/notion/c3bccb26-39af-48d5-af8b-4b5faf25bcf1/xX_CY-0EWG-480.jpeg)\n\n\nAlso, this reminds me that I need to continue reading the manga! I stopped because I was so busy that didn’t have much time and energy, and the fact that it was mirrored to read left to right didn’t help.

      "title": "Geekosaur News 21: Games!",
      "content": "\nIt’s been a long time since the last Geekosaur News - our ~~weekly~~ very infrequent and occasional newsletter. But this time, let’s talk a bit about games!\n\n\n## New games for me\n\n\nThis weekend I got two games for the Nintendo Switch: Triangle Strategy and Mario Kart 8.\n\n\nTriangle Strategy is a tactical jrpg that looks so cool! Aside from the graphics, it’s a story focused game, with about 20 chapters, and one battle on each chapter (plus training battles you can do as you progress). \n\n\nThat’s a big plus for me, since I have some difficulty with rpgs where you just keep getting random battles every 2 minutes and can’t progress on the story. It’s also cool that it’s a tactical one!\n\n\nAnd since there was a Mario sale this weekend, my wife was interested in getting Mario Kart so we could eventually play a little bit together. I guess it’s not something we will be playing a lot, but it’s nice to have it available.\n\n\n## News and discussions\n\n\nTalking about kart games, I was interested in Chocobo GP, since I used to play Chocobo Racing on my PS1 when I was a kid. Unfortunately, it ended up being a full priced game that’s behaves like a mobile game in terms of getting you to pay for everything. It’s such a turn-off, but I guess it happens nowadays. And that’s one of the reasons I avoid preordering games. ([reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/tduz50/psa_do_not_buy_chocobo_gp_for_your_children/))\n\n\nI was watching the video below on big releases for the Switch this year, and one of the things that he says is that there’s a lot of tactical RPGs. Not that I’m complaining, of course :) \n\n\n[bookmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYDd6xwDZ4)\n\n\nI know I’m not going to be playing many games anyway, but I would say I’m interested at least in Digimon Survive and Metal Slug Tactics. Although I loved Advance Wars, I’m not a big fan of the new visuals :/. Really prefer the 2d/anime style.\n\n\nBTW, Digimon Survive seems very promising. I hope it’s a great game!\n\n\n[bookmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gyu7tf3R4)\n\n"
