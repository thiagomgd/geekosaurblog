      "content": "<p>Nice!</p><p>&gt; A new IGN interview with Lorcana's co-designer and brand manager Ryan Miller revealed one of the most important ways the upcoming Disney game plans to prioritize fans: never making cards exclusive to cons or events. Some concerns had been raised about this after D23 attendees could acquire special foil versions of the recently announced cards, but Miller stated that while the cards have a different appearance, they will function no differently than the regular versions of the cards. On the subject, Miller stated that: \"I don’t like to say ‘never’ when working on a trading card game, but here I go: We’ll never do a promo card or collection that you can’t also get out of the regular product.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/disney-lorcana-pokemon-tcg-trading-card-promos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">screenrant.com/disney-lorcana-</span><span class=\"invisible\">pokemon-tcg-trading-card-promos/</span></a><br>  </p>",
