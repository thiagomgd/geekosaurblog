Here, the magic is called Power, and everyone has one kind: alter gravity, healing, teleport, control the weather, just to name a few. Jake Sullivan, our hero (not that he really wants to be one), is a Heavy, being able to control the pull and intensity of gravity. He's a really good one, knowing more about the Power than almost anyone.<br><br>I liked that the characters are varied, with different Powers and personalities, each one being part of the plot and connected to each one in ways that you can't imagine. The plot is very good too, and although you can read this first volume as some sort of stand alone, you'll finish it wanting more and being anxious to know more about that thing that I can't say because its spoiler.<br><br>This book is full of surprises that make you like it even more at every page read. Several nights I went to sleep late because I didn't want to stop reading, and the pacing just keep speeding up, with more twists and cool things happening and being revealed all the time.","",,"",No

It uses a blend of real places and people, to serve as a base to the mysteries the protagonist will help to solve. And I say mysteries because the cases aren't necessary homicides.<br><br>It takes place in the village of Near Sawrey, London, at the start of the 20th century, and in addition to  showing what the humans characters are doing, it also shows the events that happen to the animals. Yes, we have sentient, talking animals, with love stories, strong friendships, and all that things. The animals also took actions that alter the course of the history.<br><br>There isn't much investigation in this book, that can be described more as a cozy than as a mystery, but it doesn't mean that the book isn't good. The reading is very pleasurable, ideal to be done on a rainy afternoon or a lazy Sunday, coupled with a hot tea.","",,"",Yes
