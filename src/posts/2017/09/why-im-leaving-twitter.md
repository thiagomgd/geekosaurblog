title: Why I'm leaving Twitter
---

For quite some time I've been discontent with Twitter, as they seem to be making a lot of bad decisions (IMHO) and helping turn the network into one filled with even more hatred and flame wars.

<!--more-->

As far as the bad (or disagreeable) decisions go, let's see the ones that I remember now and makes me most unhappy. First, we don't have a chronological timeline anymore, it's completely gone and we can't change/set this in any way. That was the first thing that made me upset, as now they have almost complete control over what I see on my timeline.

But you would say that the nonchronological timeline is not so bad and that I still control what I see. But you're wrong, completely. Now, they force me to see posts from people I don't follow, just because someone that I follow has liked it. And of course, you can't turn that "feature" off.

Another new feature that had a bad impact was the quote RT. It's not a bad feature per se, but it also affects how you start seeing flame Wars on your timeline. And of course, you can't opt out and change the settings that no one can quote RT you,  at least not that I know. With that, some discussions that would be limited to other people's timelines, are now part of your feed.

Of course, there are other changes that I or other people may not like, but the second and third features, especially, makes everything on Twitter way worse.

_Note: I found two ways to deal with likes appearing on my timeline. One is to use a third-party client. This solves the problem, but only when I'm on mobile, and of course, I could use a 3rd party client on Windows desktop, but it's still not ideal, and not the solution I would like. The other option was to open the options on a tweet and select "I don't like this", and after repeating this a few times, voila, it's working. But still, I wish Twitter stopped imposing this changes to us, without the option to turn it off._

A final thing that bothers me about Twitter is the character limit. If Twitter wants to evolve from the original *What are you doing now* to more extended and important discussions and interactions, 140 characters are far from enough. Not only does that makes threads and conversations harder to follow, as a user has to post 3 tweets in a row to make a single statement, but it also induces users to interrupt each other more often, as someone would reply to the first tweet in your series, before you even have time to post the continuation.

_Note 2: this post was written before Twitter's announce that it'll be rising the limit to 280 characters. Still, my concerns still applies, and I would like to see a 500 limit, or maybe even something more linke Tumblr, having a title/short text, with the usueal 140 characters, and then an 'attached' text, with maybe a 500 or 1k limit_

I still have fun using it, especially now that I was able to get rid of the likes on my timeline, but I have to admit that Twitter is not the only one changing. Its users, or at last a big part of them, are using the network to pick fights with each other, attacking other users and using the quote retweet (a feature that I used to love) to spread hate and shame the poster, making the tweet visible to a completely different audience than it was originally conceived to.

You can still follow me on Twitter (@gen_falcon), but now I'm more active on niu.moe/@falcon, a mastodon instance mainly for nerds and anime fans. See you [there](niu.moe/@falcon). You can also see the about page on niu's server [HERE](https://niu.moe/about/more).
