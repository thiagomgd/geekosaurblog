title: Top 3 - Light Novel I Want In English
---

Official light novel translations are gaining traction, and every month we get a bunch of new releases. 
From Yen Press' to J-Novel Club's digital only releases, we have plenty of choices about what to start reading. 
But of course, we are never happy, as there's a HUGE amount of titles being published in the Japanese market. 
Many of them are adapted into anime and, as we finish watching it, we're left wanting more, and without knowing the rest of the story. 
Below I've listed 3 light novels that I want to have a translation.

- 3: Boukyaku Tantei Series

It's about mystery solving, it has an interesting plot and a good MAL ranking (although I'm not a 'believer' of rankings, 
but that's for another post). For a fan of the mystery genre, seems like a great read.

> Twenty-five-year-old Kakushidate Yakusuke suffers from the fate of constantly stumbling into various crime scenes and ending up being the main suspect.
> 
> His last resort: Okitegami Kyouko the "Quickest Detective." However, Kyouko suffers from a strange case of amnesia; 
whenever she falls asleep, she forgets everything that happened the previous day, making her solve the mysteries within one day.

- 2: Amagi Brilliant Park

I really had good moments with this anime. It was a nice surprise, and I still want to know what happened after the anime ended. 
A story about a park full of magical creatures from another world, posing as the park's mascots is a good shift in the overdone 'transported to a magic world' trope.

Note: the first 2 volumes were translated by nanodesu, but it's not available anymore since a DMCA takedown.

> Seiya was forced to accept an invitation to an amusement park by the mysterious and beautiful girl Isuzu. 
What he didn't know was that she would bring him to the decrepit Amagi Brilliant Park, Japan's most disappointing amusement park. 
Seiya is introduced to the leader of the Park, the "real princess" Latifa, who suddenly entrusts him with saving the park, 
which is in danger of shutting down. Amagi Brilliant Park, it turns out, is not just any amusement park, but rather one populated by fairies.

- 1: Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace)

Another anime that I liked a lot. The plot is interesting, the characters are lovable and relatable, and it left a void after it ended. 
Seems that I'm not alone, wanting a translation for this one: it ranked 4th in a 
[pool made by nanodesu](https://nanodesutranslations.wordpress.com/2016/07/19/new-project-poll-up-to-4-new-projects-will-open/) last year, 
asking about future projects. 

Basically, Hatoko is the best girl, and I want more of her! Watch the scene below to see if you don't agree with me :)

> Half a year ago, the four members of a literature club, as well as the elementary school niece of their faculty adviser, 
were bestowed with supernatural powers. The boy in the club, Ando Jurai, became able to produce black flames. 
The girls acquired a variety of powerful abilities: Tomoyo could slow, speed, or stop time, 
Hatoko could control the five elements (earth, water, fire, wind, light), little Chifuyu could create things, 
and Sayumi could repair objects or heal living things. 
However, since they gained these powers, nothing has really changed in their everyday life. 
Why have they been given these powers in the first place? Will the heroic fantasy life they imagined these powers would bring ever actually arrive?
