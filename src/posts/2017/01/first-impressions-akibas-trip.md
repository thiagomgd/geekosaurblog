After a weak (for me) season, the Winter 2017 season is here, and Akiba's Trip (or Akiba Strip ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) is the first to be released.

> Set in Akihabara, the shopping area has been invaded by creatures known as "Synthisters" who prey on the patrons of Akihabara, 
feasting on their social energy and will to live. These enemies can only be stopped by direct exposure to sunlight, 
meaning to defeat these synthisters their clothes need to be ripped off exposing them to sunlight.

Based on a game, this is an anime that doesn't event try to take itself seriously, and that's good. 
Instead of trying to be smart, it uses some of the weirder aspects of the otaku style of life as the source of humor and entertainment, 
and it succeeds in doing it. The plot is bizarre, but no so much that'll make it painfully crazy or unwatchable. 
The setting (Akihabara) makes it even more interesting to watch.

The art is colorful and, while not outstanding, it's good enough so you enjoy seeing it. 
I liked the character designs, which in many cases, constitutes of costumes or some more 'otaku-style' wear. Of course, it's Akihabara after all.

The humor is not anything new, and I fear that the 'stripping the bugs' gag will start to wear off. 
But besides that, the episode had some nice quotes, and I hope that they continue that way, instead of relying only on the underwear scenes.

It's far from perfect, and not for everyone, but I see a great promise on this series, and at least for now, I'll continue to watch it.

__Watch it:__ *if you want some 'dumb fun', ecchi and fight scenes and an otaku setting.*

__Don't watch it:__ *if you want something meaningful, deep or innovative.*
