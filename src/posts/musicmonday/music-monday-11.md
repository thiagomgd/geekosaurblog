This is a German band and, while they have cool songs, today I’m sharing their covers because OMGTHOSEARESOCOOL! Let’s start with Can't Get You out of My Head by Kylie Minogue, which they recorded along with another band called Parcels.

If you are ancient like me, you probably are familiar with Tom’s Diner. If you don’t remember it by the name, the first 1 second might be enough to make you remember. Played with Giant Rooks

Something a bit newer: Valerie, played with Natalie Findlay and featuring a sweet flugelhorn solo!

Come Together is a classic, right?
