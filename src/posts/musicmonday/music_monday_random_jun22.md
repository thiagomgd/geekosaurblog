Last week I started checking some random music on Youtube, and went down the rabbit hole (as always).

Here's some of the things I checked, enjoy!

Starting with something less random: a rock cover of Dance Monkey

## Orchestral

How about some orchestral music? Here we have a version of Sonic's Green Hill Zone, and also a live recording of The Hobbit's Misty Mountain

{% youtube 'ScziwuuWf_M' %}

{% youtube 'ubHSQ-wu7hw' %}

## Medieval Music

How about this version on the great What Is Love?

{% youtube 'Kbj4bulZX2Y' %}

I have no idea what a "hardcore medieval party" is, but hey, there's a mix for that.

## Random Stuff

This lady here is a great spoon player. Yes, spoon.

Gangsta bluegrass or, Gangstagrass

{% youtube 'cCEHQ_nhxOA' %}

At last: if you have rhythm, one string is more than enough
