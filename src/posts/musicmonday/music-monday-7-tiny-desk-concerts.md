Another week, another Music Monday, this time with some Tiny Desk concerts, which I love.

<!--more-->

First one is Camila Cabello. I never paid much attention to her music, but as always, went ahead and gave it a try on a NPR Tiny Desk Concert which, in this case, is not tiny at all. But it's SO good. I absolutely loved the band, mariachis, and the trumpet solos. It's such a delight to listen to it.

Never heard of Nicki Nicole before, but that was really cool! I've been listening to this at least once a day for the past week!

And another cool one is Jenny and the Mexicats. Cool band, lead singer also plays trumpet, what's not to love?
