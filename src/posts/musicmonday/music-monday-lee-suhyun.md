This weekend my wife and I were listening to some k-pop again, including Lee Suhyun. I was familiar with her work as AKMU (Akdong Musician), but somewhat recently we watched Mad For Each Other and she had a role there - and yes, she sings there. Also, she recorded a Lala Land cover with Lee Dongwook (Goblin, Strangers From Hell), and it's really nice.

So, let's start with this cool MV: Alien. I loved the visuals, specially the mix with cartoon/comics visuals.

Of course, I also need to share the cover mentioned before. They both worked so well together.

And to wrap up, she also covered BTS' Buter!
