Recently I’ve discovered My Analog Journal channel on Youtube, and it’s SO great! I love how eclectic it is, with music and guest DJs from many different countries. 


Since I’m from Brazil, I’m going with some Brazilian music mixes. But be sure to tune in the channel to see more interesting and different music!
