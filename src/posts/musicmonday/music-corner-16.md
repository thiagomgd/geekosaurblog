This weekend was time to watch Stranger Things S4 (part 1). And if you watched it - or was on Twitter over the weekend - you know that Running Up That Hill from Kate Bush was there. And WHAT AN AMAZING CHOICE.

This song shows up on the first episodes, but then it plays at the end of episode 4 - Dear Billy. The whole episode was incredible, and that ending was just too good not to leave a lasting impression. Great scene and this song matches it so well.

Of course, I think everyone remembers NeverEnding Story from Season 3

And below, we have the OST for season 4. As always, a great selection.
