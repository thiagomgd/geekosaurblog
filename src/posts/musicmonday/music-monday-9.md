This weekend I was creating a couples playlists on Youtube Music, with songs that I used to play with my bands back in Brazil. And how that brings back memories.

So, we used to play a few Blues Brothers tunes, and because of that I ended up listening to it for quite a good part of the day today, so that's what I'm sharing here. Enjoy!
