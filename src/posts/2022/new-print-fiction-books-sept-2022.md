Huge TBR, small apartment, but this past week I still got some new additions to my shelves.

A Venon Dark And Sweet by Judy I. Lin ([GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58484120-a-venom-dark-and-sweet)) is the 2nd in a duology of historical-fantasy where magic is in the tea? I’m reading the 1st volume still - A Magic Steeped In Poison - but having fun enough that I decided to just go ahead and get the second volume. Also, IT’S SO BEAUTIFUL!!!

What If? 2 by Randall Munroe ([GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60190659-what-if-2)), the creator of XKCD, is a book where he answers absurd questions in the most scientifically accurate way possible. I read the first volume on Kindle, but since it has a lot of illustrations and footnotes, it’s going to be better this way. Also, I generally prefer non-fiction on paper. This is a pre-order from May.

The next 2 books I bought online on Sunday, since Indigo had a promotion to get a lot of points when spending more than $X. So I ended up buying 5 books, and those 2 where ready the next day:

Fairy Tale by Stephen King ([GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60177377-fairy-tale)) is… a magic book by Stephen King. Not like I really need to say more, right? It’s huge and the font is small, so I guess I’m in for a (wonderful) long ride!

Kitty And The Moonlight Rescue ([GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43245876-kitty-and-the-moonlight-rescue)) is a kids book I got for my wife. She loved the art style, and she’s an illustrator that does children’s clothes so… good way to give her something she would love.
