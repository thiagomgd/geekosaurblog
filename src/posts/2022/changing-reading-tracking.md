Last year, I started logging how much time I was reading every day, separated in Fiction, Nonfiction, Learning and Manga ([Like I posted here](/post/reading-stats-so-far-sept2021/)). During December, I gave up and stopped doing that, even though it was kind of a nice data to keep track of. 

I'm still going to be tracking how much I read, but in a different way: instead of time per day, I'll use pages per week. The main reason for that change is that this is a less involved way of tracking my reading habits, and will interfere less ith my actual reading time.

Think about it. Every time I went to read something, I would pick my phone and start the timer on my time tracking app. Then stop when finished, or when going to the washroom or kitchen. But this is a great way of desincentivizing small reading sessions, and force me to keep my phone with me, instead of away from me.

Now, my plan is to once a week write down the current page I'm reading in my current books, compare with the previous week and write down the difference. Something I will probably spend like 5 min. doing. I'll also have to write down if I finish a book during the week, but that's perfectly fine.

What I also like about this, is that this can be an incentive for me to journal a bit and also maybe keep track or other habits/goals. Let's see how it goes.
