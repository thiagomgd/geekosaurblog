There was a book tag trending on Mastodon (I‚Äôm there as [@falcon@mindly.social](https://mindly.social/@falcon), and phasing out Twitter usage) that‚Äôs #7Books. I‚Äôm late to the thing as always, but let‚Äôs see mine, in no particular order:

### 1 - Enterprise Stardust (Perry Rhodan series)

I‚Äôm adding the first book here, since it was my introduction to this wonderful series. I‚Äôve read the first 39 or 49? Like, almost the first cycle. I really do wish to get back to it. Every time I watch/read some sci-fi with space-travel, I get reminded of it. Not only it was a lot of fun, but I‚Äôve got some fond memories.

I was reading the original series, but J-Novel Club is releasing Perry Rhodan NEO, the 2011 reboot. I already have the 1st digital volume, and I guess I will check it out soon-ish.

### 2 - Hard Magic (Grimnoir Chronicles, #1)

This is a really fun alternate-history-urban-fantasy trilogy, with one of the best magical systems - or at least, coolest ones - I‚Äôve ever seen. Along with Perry Rhodan, this one was also responsible for me going to sleep late quite a few nights.

### 3 - The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking)

This is an absolute must read if you have any interest in astronomy, astrophysics, or just the space in general. Even though it‚Äôs astrophysics, the book is laid out in a way that‚Äôs very easy to understand, while still going deep enough to be very relevant. 11 out of 10, with a gold start sticker on it. _Also go follow the author, Katie Mack, online (_[_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/AstroKatie)_)_.

### 4 - House Of Secrets

Besides Harry Potter and Twilight, this is a series that I share a connection with my mother. She read the first 2 books right after me, but then the 3rd one was taking too long to come out in Portuguese, so I ended up getting it in English on my Kindle. But then after it was released, of course I had to get it for her.

### 5 - Furiously Happy: A Funny Book About Horrible Things

I was never a big non-fiction reader, but this was a book that kinda changed my perception about memoirs. It‚Äôs SO fun, heartwarming AND heartbreaking at times, Jenny Lawson is just too great of a writer.

### 6 - The Hound of the Baskervilles (or all Sherlock Holmes books?)

Sherlock Holmes was a huge for me when I was younger. I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of it at some point. It definitely made me fall even more in love with mysteries, and this is one that not only was fun, but I do remember grabbing it at the bookstore when I was a ‚Äúkid‚Äù.

Bonus here: I also like The Boscombe Valley Mystery a lot.

### 7 - Keeper of The Lost Cities (Keeper Of The Lost Cities #1)

I‚Äôm fond of this series, but also one of the reasons is that, a while after I read the first 3 books that I got in a boxed set, I lent it to my late grandmother, and she also really enjoyed it. Even though we didn‚Äôt talk much about it, but some time after that I came to Canada, and she passed away a year and a half later üòï

I ended up reading book 4 (or 4 and 5) in 2018 while I was in Toronto, but only actually got back to the series this year. Maybe just something I wanted to do to reconnect? But anyway, I ended up almost catching up, and the latest one, Stellarlune was just released, and is on my shelf just waiting for me to start it. I just need to read the 8.5 novella first

So, I guess that‚Äôs it!

Of course, there are many more great books that I would love to talk about, but this is enough for you to have a glimpse on my reading. You can also always check my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22638412-falcon), or even my [Books Per Year](https://geekosaur.com/books-per-year/) page here on my blog.
