Finally got the time to watch the 2nd episode of this season’s Spy X Family, and had a lot of fun with it.

As always, Yor is damn scary when it comes to protecting Anya. Don’t mess with mama bear.

And it was so cool to finally watch Anya and Bond working together. Also loved how they portray Anya as an actual kid, including her though process and not knowing so many things - like how to read time on a clock.

> “How many minutes is 30 minutes”, Anya

> "So it was a bomb, not an eggplant.”, Spy guy

We still have next episode to wrap up this mission and Bond’s introduction to the family, and I’m all in for it!
