As time passes and our TBR grows, it's easy to lose track of books we really want to read. I get easily distracted, lazy, and then the year ends and I didn't do much of what I hoped to.

So I decided to list some non-fiction books (or categories) that are a must read to me this year. Let's see!

_The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change_ is a book that my manager recommended, and it's the one I'll try to read January/February. Other possible books on career include _A Philosophy of Software Design_, _The Score Takes Care of Itself: My Philosophy of Leadership_ and _Invent and Wander: The Collected Writings of Jeff Bezos_.

_The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma_ is a recommendation from my family doctor. I've had a couple injuries in the last few years, and had a hard time recovering - seems like nothing ever was 100% again. Understanding how our minds and the stress can affect the body seems really like a good idea.

_Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything_ and _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_: these are books that I was loving reading a couple years ago, and not sure why I stopped. So I have to get back to them and finally finish!

_Letters From An Astrophysicist_, _Brief Answers to the Big Questions_ + something else: I have a few books about space, and reading more about the topic would definitely be cool. Those two are my 2 top choices and then, if possible, I'll read more of what I have.

And last but not the least, books on philosophy and poetry (and actual poetry books). I have a few already, including _Meditations_, _How To Think Like a Roman Emperor_, and I was in the middle of Poetry 101, and I have Emily Dickinson, Poe and a Romantic Poetry collections.
