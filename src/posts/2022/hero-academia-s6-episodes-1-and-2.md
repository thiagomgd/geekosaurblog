As always, I’m late. But anyways… let’s have a quick check!

Those 2 episodes were really cool, and season 6 is off to a great start. The 1st episode was setting everything up, and bringing us a bit up to speed from Season 5. And the 2nd went full-on battle, with Mirko and Kaminari being the highlights! Not going to complain here

This Kaminari/Jirou moment was so nice, and then Kaminari showed that he is powerful indeed!

And seeing Mirko in action was just awesome. She is strong and kinda terrifying? Wouldn’t want to be on her bad side, unless you are wishing for death.

And I can totally see some of you perverts saying _death by snu-snu_:
