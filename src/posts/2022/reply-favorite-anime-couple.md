This week, thespookyredhead asked: What’s your favorite anime couple?

I would say that for me, it’s Keiichi and Belldandy, from Oh My Goddess. This is my favorite anime of all time, holds a place dear to my heart, and I absolutely adore Belldandy and Keiichi and Belldandy as a couple.

Also, this reminds me that I need to continue reading the manga! I stopped because I was so busy that didn’t have much time and energy, and the fact that it was mirrored to read left to right didn’t help. But I guess it’s time to continue.
