This Friday Iâ€™m reading Legends & Latte, which I got this week. Iâ€™m about 100 pages in, and so far really liking it ðŸ™‚


A good quote about coffee:


> It was like drinking the feeling of being peaceful. Being peaceful in your mind. Well, not if you have too much, then itâ€™s something else


This one is also nice:


> _Things donâ€™t have to stay as what they started out as._


Also, if you want, have a look at itâ€™s page on TV Tropes: [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegendsAndLattes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegendsAndLattes)
