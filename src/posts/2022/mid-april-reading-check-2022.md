Earlier this month I shared my reading goals for April 2022 ([see it here](https://geekosaur.com/post/reading-plans-april-2022/)). I defined goals for books (fiction and non-fiction) and also manga (not a ‘goal’ though, since I didn’t specify how many chapters).

Any way, most of my reading this month so far has been for manga: I’ve read 240 chapters of One Piece! I’m currently in the Skypiea arc, but it’s probably time to start taking it easy, unless I want to miserably fail at my book goals, haha.

But it was not a bad month so far, I was just busier and with less energy for books, as I mentioned in the [last Geekosaur News](https://geekosaur.com/post/geekosaur-news-23/). Also, I wasn’t planning on getting involved in photography, and investigating which camera and lens to get, trying to find it - and then going out for photo walks - takes time, but was very enjoyable.

This is how much I read on the past couple weeks

I think it’s alright everything considered. But I’ll make some effort for the rest of the month!
