I just recently made a post about new print books I got, and then yesterday I received an email that some more from my last order were ready to pick up.

I was only expecting them next week, but I guess Iâ€™m happy! And I already started reading one of them: [The Trials of Morrigan Crow (Nevermoor #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34219873-the-trials-of-morrigan-crow).

The other book I got where: _Wundersmith: The Calling of Morrigan Crow_ and _Hollowpox: The Hunt for Morrigan Crow_, which are the 2nd and 3rd books on the Nevermoor series - I got the boxset ðŸ™‚

I also got [Spineless](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59131384-spineless) by Samantha San Miguel, which sounds really interesting and fun, and has a gorgeous cover!
