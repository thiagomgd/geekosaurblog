I recently posted a bunch of new fiction books I got recently, and I guess nowâ€™s the time to share books I preordered and Iâ€™m waiting to receive!

Legends & Latter by Travis Baldree is what seems like a western and D&D take on the slice-of-life genre, and itâ€™s been very well received. Got it as part of recent online order, and just waiting to get my hands on this!

Stellarlune is the 9th book in the wonderful The Keeper of The Lost Cities series, by Shannon Messenger. I got the first 3 books in a box set many years ago and fell in love with it. I put the series on hold after volume 5 in 2018, as each book was getting bigger and bigger, but this year I decided to go back to the series and WOW. Itâ€™s still so much fun, but also growing so much.

I absolutely recommend this series! I still need to read book 8 before this release, but I do have enough time ðŸ™‚

The Ghost Woods by C. J. Cooke is something I just had to preorder. Not only does it hit so many right buttons - specially for a fall/winter read, but itâ€™s by the same author of The Lighthouse Witches, which I read last year and found it SO enjoyable - [see my short review here](https://geekosaur.com/post/the-lighthouse-witches-book-notes/). Very excited for this!

The Poisoners Ring (A Rip Through Time #2) by Kelley Armstrong. Now, this one I still didnâ€™t preorder, but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m going to do it soon; as soon as Iâ€™m 100% decided to go with the hardcover version, as this time thereâ€™s no paperback release announced yet. I would prefer a paperback for this, but for a mystery, I feel like a print release is better than eBook. Also, I have the 1st one in paperback (which I also preordered at the time). Plus, this is from a Canadian author. Hooray!
