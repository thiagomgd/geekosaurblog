I think posting my reading goals for this month might be a good way of keeping my focus, and might do that every month - I hope - and also try that for movies and TV shows. Let’s see!

## Books

### Non-Fiction

For non-fiction, there are 2 books I wanna read. And I’m probably going to only have time to actually finish 1, and start the other.

One of them I ordered this Friday, and should be arriving tomorrow. It’s Courage To Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga. I never read Self Help books, but this sounds interesting and I really wanna give it a try. There’s a video review on Youtube, by Ali Abdaal ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf4Hs5E9eNg)).

The other one is a science book I got last year: The End of Everything (Astrophisically Speaking) by Katie Mack. I always wanted to read more about space and astrophysics, and this one sounds so good. Also, be sure to [follow Katie on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AstroKatie), it’s great!

### Fiction

I’m “currently reading” Strange Weather In Tokyo, but I think I need something more adventure, fun and relaxing, specially since I’m going to try to read some non-fiction, and want to try ramping up on my German learning. So I’m going with Death Masks (The Dresden Files #5) by Jim Butcher. This is a highly entertaining Urban Fantasy series, with lots of action, some fun scenes and cool plot and world.

## Manga

Recently I started reading One Piece again. I read some of it - about 20, 21 volumes - when it first started being published in Brazil, but distribution in my area was horrible, I ended up missing a volume or two, and then the publisher went under so... I tried again years later (still like 10 years ago), but at that time, I was not up for the commitment. After #ONEPIECE1044 was trending on Twitter, I decided to finally give it another try. So that’s what I’ll be reading in April.

I’ll also be either continuing reading Black Clover - I read about 180 chapters on 2020, while I was “stranded” at my parent’s place in Brazil because of the pandemic - and maybe now it’s time to continue it. OR, I’m going to be starting My Hero Academia manga, since I’m a big fan of the anime.

One Punch Man is going to be paused for a while probably.
