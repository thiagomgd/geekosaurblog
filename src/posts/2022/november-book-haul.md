Preordering books is nice. You go on with you life and then you receive an email that your books are ready! That always make a bookworm happy.

_The Ghost Woods was actually released on October, but Indigo seemed to lose my package (even though it was a pick-up in store order), and here I am. Got it like 20 days later._

The first book is The Ghost Woods by C. J. Cooke. I LOVED The Lighthouse Witches and had to get this one ([check my review here](https://geekosaur.com/post/the-lighthouse-witches-book-notes/)). Should be an excellent read for the winter nights. I’m also happy that the cover also kinda matches the The Lighthouse Witches vibe, even with some details in… high relief printing? Is that how you say it? Anyway, it looks gorgeous and I need to read it soon.

_Dies buried under own TBR pile_

Legends & Lattes was highly praised for quite some time, and now got a new release by Tor Books, which is the one I got. Congratulations Travis Baldree!!!

I’m starting Legends & Lattes today!!

The last one on the small haul is Stellarlune (Keeper Of The Lost Cities #9) by Shannon Messenger. After a long hiatus, I returned to this series a few months ago and devoured the remaining books I haven’t read before, just in time for the new release. I actually finished the 8th volume a few days ago.

I’m saving it for after Legends & Lattes because I’m also reading another hardback (A Magic Steeped In Poison), and want something lighter to read in bed. Plus, I think I still need to read a short story on vol. 8.5 (Unlocked). Let’s see how it goes!

Below are the GoodReads links for the books mentioned.
