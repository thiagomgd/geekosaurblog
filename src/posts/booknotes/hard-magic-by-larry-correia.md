Despite always being interested in the Urban Fantasy genre, I don't remember having read any recently. Not for lack of options, but mainly because YA and _regular_ fantasy have a massive presence on blogs and YouTube channels, so there's always a new great book _that everyone should be reading_ coming out. Another reason is because the genre is even less popular here in Brazil, resulting in an impressive lack of options in Portuguese. But now that I'm reading mainly in English and I have a Kindle, it's waaaay easier for me to finally give it a try to some great Urban Fantasy books.

I was supposed to start my journey with the first book in The Dresden Files series: Storm Front by Jim Butcher. My Want-To-Read shelf on GoodReads was filled with other interesting books too, but then I discovered Hard Magic by Larry Correia, the first book on The Grimnoir Chronicles series and decided to buy and read it. And I'm REALLY glad that I did.

This is a mix of Urban Fantasy, Steampunk, Alternate History and Science Fiction, with a bit of Dark Fantasy too. Here, the magic is called Power, and everyone has one kind: alter gravity, healing, teleport, control the weather, just to name a few. Jake Sullivan, our hero (not that he really wants to be one), is a Heavy, being able to control the pull and intensity of gravity. He's a really good one, knowing more about the Power than almost anyone.

I liked that the characters are varied, with different Powers and personalities, each one being part of the plot and connected to each one in ways that you can't imagine. The plot is very good too, and although you can read this first volume as some sort of stand alone, you'll finish it wanting more and being anxious to know more about _that thing that I can't say because its spoiler._

> Heinrich scowled. “You’ve got a real problem with zombies, don’t you?”  
> “I only want to have to kill somebody once. Killing them twice seems like work."

This book is full of surprises that make you like it even more at every page read. Several nights I went to sleep late because I didn't want to stop reading, and the pacing just keep speeding up, with more twists and cool things happening and being revealed all the time.

> He took his place in a comfortable recliner and opened first to the obituaries, as was his daily custom, to see if anyone he disliked had died, but sadly the announcements held no joy.

So all I can say is: READ THIS DAMN BOOK AND THANK ME LATER!

Harry Dresden is the best at what he does. Well, technically, he's the only at what he does. So when the Chicago P.D. has a case that transcends mortal creativity or capability, they come to him for answers. For the "everyday" world is actually full of strange and magical things—and most don't play well with humans. That's where Harry comes in. Takes a wizard to catch a—well, whatever. There's just one problem. Business, to put it mildly, stinks.{% endmyembed %}

Enter Verity Price. Despite being trained from birth as a cryptozoologist, she'd rather dance a tango than tangle with a demon, and is spending a year in Manhattan while she pursues her career in professional ballroom dance. Sounds pretty simple, right?...{% endmyembed %}

Like the rest of America, Scranton's got an uneasy 'live and let unlive' relationship with the supernatural. But when a vamp puts the bite on an unwilling victim, or some witch casts the wrong kind of spell, that's when they call Markowski. He carries a badge. Also, a crucifix, some wooden stakes, a big vial of holy water, and a 9mm Beretta loaded with silver bullets.{% endmyembed %}
