I'm a big fan of cozy mysteries and for a long time I was interested on the Witchcraft Mystery series by Juliet Blackwell. 
Let's see: it's a cozy mystery about witches, so what's not to love about it? 
So, after seeing that the kindle edition of the first book was on sale, 
I decided it'll be finally time to give it a try. And I don't regret it one bit.

> Lily Ivory is not your average witch. Her spell-casting powers tend to draw 
mischievous spirits while keeping normal humans at a distance. 
But now her vintage clothing store could give her a chance to make friends in San Francisco....  
Lily hopes for a normal life when she opens Aunt Cora's Closet. With her magical knack for vintage fashion - 
she can sense vibrations of the past from clothing and jewelry - her store becomes a big hit.  
But when a client is murdered and children start disappearing from the Bay Area, 
Lily may be the only one who can unravel the crime. She tries to keep her identity a secret while investigating, 
but it's not easy - especially under the spells of sexy "mythbuster" Max Carmichael and powerful witch Aidan Rhodes. 
Will Lily's witchy ways be forced out of the closet

The last cozy mystery I read was 
[Caught Dead Handed (Witch City Mystery, #1) by Carol J. Perry](http://www.bookdepository.com/Caught-Dead-Handed-Carol-J-Perry/9781617733697?a_aid=thiagomgd), 
also a cozy mystery about a witch. 
But while the first takes place in the small Salem, Secondhand Spirits tells us the story of Lily Ivory, 
a real witch that recently moved to San Francisco and opened a vintage clothing store. 
From a mysterious male-witch, she earns Oscar, 
a goblin familiar who can turn himself as a guinea pig to walk among the non-magical folk.

The characters are really nice, and although they aren't all deeply developed, at least in this first book, 
they aren't plain either. And this isn't a problem at all, because unless you have a book with just a few characters, 
and a character-driven story, there won't be space to tell us the past of all of them. 
Besides, it's a mystery book, so getting to know the characters better as the series progress is something welcome.

> “Ooh! How much is she paying you?” Oscar hopped around the kitchen in his excitement.  
“Firstborn? Life of duty? Web site?”  
That last option threw me. “Web site?”  
“Master Rhodes had a supplicant make him an interactive Web site. You should see it. It’s awesome.”  
Times do change.

I really enjoyed this book, and it's highly recommended for it's lovely characters, nice setting and the magic-filled story.
