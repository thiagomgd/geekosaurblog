My notes and thoughts on The Lighthouse Witches by C. J. Cooke.

<!--more-->

This book was a very interesting read, with a mystery of disappeared people, witches burned and a story told by mother and daughters, twenty years apart.

Twenty years later, one is found--but she's still the same age as when she disappeared. The secrets of witches have reached across the centuries in this chilling Gothic thriller from the author of the acclaimed The Nesting.{% endmyembed %}

I enjoyed the POVs from Liv, Saffy and Luna, and experiencing the story through their eyes was a great experience and helped a lot in understanding the characters more. They are well written and each add their side to the whole story, that we slowly piece together.

The mystery is well told and it builds up the suspense and your interest and curiosity as you go. It is a slow burn on the first 2 thirds of the book - not that it is a bad thing - and then, when you start understanding and everything starts to make sense and click on your mind... that's just fantastic!

In the end, I picked up this book because it was beautiful and the plot sounded interesting - specially for an October read - but was gladly surprised on how much I liked it after I finished!

> Forgiveness is a kind of time travel, only better. Because it sutures the wounds of the past with the wisdom of the present, at the same moment as it promises a better future.

Most of the time reading this book, I was listening to The Serpent soundtrack, which I leave the first track below!
