I have to admit: I never read Percy Jackson, even though I have all the book at home (my mother totally love this series). 
I think I got lazy and didn't want to read a story that I already (sort of) know. 
But this year I finally redeemed myself, reading 2 Rick Riordan books: 
The Sword of Summer (Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard #1) and The Hidden Oracle (The Trials of Apollo #1). 
So, let's talk about the first one.

<!--more-->

> Magnus Chase has always been a troubled kid. Since his mother’s mysterious death, he’s lived alone on the streets of Boston, 
surviving by his wits, keeping one step ahead of the police and the truant officers.  
One day, he’s tracked down by a man he’s never met—a man his mother claimed was dangerous. 
The man tells him an impossible secret: Magnus is the son of a Norse god.  
The Viking myths are true. The gods of Asgard are preparing for war. 
Trolls, giants and worse monsters are stirring for doomsday. 
To prevent Ragnarok, Magnus must search the Nine Worlds for a weapon that has been lost for thousands of years.  
When an attack by fire giants forces him to choose between his own safety and the lives of hundreds of innocents, Magnus makes a fatal decision.  
Sometimes, the only way to start a new life is to die . . .

## About the book

Magnus Chase is a kid that is living on the streets since his mother's death. 
He has two friends that are also homeless and an uncle that her mother told him to stay away from. 
But, after fighting a fire giant and dying (yes), he goes to Valhalla and discovers that he is the son of Freya, a nordic goddess.

Valhalla is a truly crazy place. 
There, battles to death are part of the everyday schedule, 
and most of them (but for Magnus) seems excited to die horribly in battle, 
only to come back to _life_, or the afterlife, later.

> “I TOLD MY NEW FRIENDS I was allergic to dismemberment. They just laughed and herded me toward the combat arena. 
This is why I don’t like making new friends.”

## The Good

### Mythology

Of course, this one has to be here: if you love mythology, 
Rick Riordan is creating a wonderful universe where gods from all mythos (Greek, Egyptian and now, Nordic) 
have human children that do jobs and go into adventures for them. Being a mythology enthusiasm, 
you can see why this book caught my attention. And on this point, the book delivers what it promises. 
We got to see a lot of the gods and a bunch of interesting details about the Norse mythos are present.

But this isn't just a trivia book. A lot of _facts_ are complete and totally invented and put there just to make us laugh. 
Which takes me to the next point!

<!-- "/post_images/SwordOfSummerQuote.jpg", "Myths are simply stories about truths we've forgotten" -->

### Sense of humor

Here's where this book shines: the humor. Some of the characters are present just for comic relief, 
but there's more than that in Sword of Summer. Valhalla or, the Hotel Valhalla, 
seems to be full of all kinds of crazed lunatics and irrational bonkers. 
Everyone there, except for Magnus, is captivated by the battles to the death, 
not just killing each other during the official contests, but also doing this on their free time.

All the places the gang visit has some kind of foolishness or strange fascination. 
I loved how in one place (the dwarves or gnomes, I think), every object has to have a name and a story, 
and how the _classic_ rules for competition involve creating objects and killing the loser.

The chapter names themselves deserves a special attention: “The Man with the Metal Bra”, “You Had One Job”, 
“Hearthstone Passes Out Even More than Jason Grace (Though I Have No Idea Who That Is)” and “How to Kill Giants Politely”

> “I hate this plan,” I said. “Let’s do it.”

### Special cameos and one universe

Rick Riordan seems to be reuniting all the old mythos into one single universe. 
Percy Jackson, the Kane Chronicles and Magnus Chase all happen in the same timeline 
(as you can check [here](https://snoworld.one/rick-riordans-mythology-timeline-of-events/)). 
That means that Magnus Chase is indeed related to Annabeth, being her cousin.

### Romance or, the lack of it

THANK GODS! There's no forced and completely unnatural romance going on at the first book in the series. 
Maybe some girl will catch Magnus' heart later on, but this book focuses on the mythology, adventure, and humor.

## The Bad

Of course, things are not perfect. Being a part of the same universe and aimed at the same public, 
Percy Jackson fans may have a deja vu while reading this. But still, it's a GODDAMN GREAT book.

## In short

The Sword of Summer is a great start of one of Rick Riordan's new book series, Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard. 
The second book, The Hammer of Thor, has an expected publication date of October 4th.
