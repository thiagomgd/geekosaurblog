After finishing [Wool](/post/wool-silo-1) by Hugh Howey, I just had to start the next volume. And what a thrill!

The second volume is a prequel to Wool, and tell us how that world came to be. Like Wool, it tells the story through different characters and now, also different times. During the first part of the book, we are shifting between 2 characters: one is before people went to the silos, and is involved in how they got built; the other is working their first shift on Silo #1. Later, we also get to see what happened to silo #17 and how Solo ended up alone there.

I loved the story and how Howey told it to us. I think he also did a great job on writing something that is unfortunately, so believable, that you can't help but read and think "This is terrible, but yeah, that's how it would go". Not very uplifting maybe, but a great read anyway.

As many times with science-fiction, this is a book that teaches us a lot about ourselves, our society, and makes us think about were we are headed.

## Quotes

> When there’s only God to blame, we forgive him. When it’s our fellow man, we destroy him.

> There was no planning for insanity. With enough revolutions and elections, enough transfers of power, eventually a madman would take the reins.

> He saw what the Senator meant, how truth and lies seemed black and white, but mixed together, they made everything gray and confusing.

> What if they were all playing the same part? What if each and every one of them was concealing the same doubts, none of them talking because they all felt so completely alone?

## Thoughts (Spoilers!)

- I thought the nanobots idea was pretty neat. How it started as something that we used to repair our cells and live longer, but then started using them to kill. Kinda frightening too!

- The horrors never stop, and it's crazy how in the end, only 1 silo is supposed to be opened. But it does make a lot of sense: if the idea was to only have people from 1 group, you can't have multiple silos opening, since they would start fighting.

- Very curious and excited to see where this is going!
