## Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes by Edith Hamilton

I used to love reading about mythology when I was younger, and for a while I've been meaning to do it again.

> This 75th anniversary edition of a classic bestseller is stunningly illustrated and designed to enchant fans of Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology at all ages.

## How the West Won: The Neglected Story of the Triumph of Modernity by Rodney Stark

> Modernity developed only in the Westâ€”in Europe and North America. Nowhere else did science and democracy arise; nowhere else was slavery outlawed. Only Westerners invented chimneys, musical scores, telescopes, eyeglasses, pianos, electric lights, aspirin, and soap.
 
## Atlas Obscura, 2nd Edition: An Explorer's Guide to the World's Hidden Wonders by Joshua Foer

From the same author of Moonwalking With Einstein, which I was reading before and loving it.

> Inspiring equal parts wonder and wanderlust, Atlas Obscura is a phenomenon of a travel book that shot to the top of bestseller lists when it was first published and changed the way we think about the world, expanding our sense of how strange and marvelous it really is.
