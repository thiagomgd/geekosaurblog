When I started this show, the first 2 season were out already. AND I BINGED BOTH SO QUICKLY. It became of of those series I absolutely love (almost) everything about: the actors, story, setting, music, costumes, comedy. I even bought the first 2 seasons' OSTs in vinyl.

For some reason though, I started season 3 when it was released, but didn't get to finish it at that time. And then I went to Brazil, and was locked there for 5 months... But coming back home decided to finally watch the second half of the season, and I loved it!!

There were a few things I didn't like so much, but overall, it was a strong season, even if not as wonderful as the first 2. I'm still very excited for the next season and what is going to happen to everyone.

On a small note: I absolutely love the cast, and I think they are perfect for each role. With that being said, I stumbled upon this comment on Reddit:

I absolutely agree that Alison Brie would also be awesome as Mrs. Maisel. And I ask: there's any other actors you think could also have been great in this show? For which character?

Regarding some things I didn't like so much, or that I really liked, SPOILER ALERT. Stop reading if you didn't watch the season yet.

Episode 5: Lenny and Midget's "date". I think it was awesome, and the characters and actors have such great chemistry. It would be GREAT if they got together, at least for a day/night. But unfortunately seems that Rachel Brosnaham begged the series creator not to have them together... I have 2 problems with that:

1. I don't think the actors should interfere with the plot. If the creator and scriptwriters (and the audience) want, they should do it. She's working there to make what the creator/producers/director are envisioning.
2. WHY NOT??? Both characters and actors have great chemistry, it's clear that Lenny likes Midget. I think forcefully avoiding that is just forcing that relationship to stagnate into a platonic interest from Lenny's part. Which will just drift them apart.

Last episode:

Ben and Midget scene at the diner: That was an incredible scene, and shows how Midge is egoistical and self-centered. I think that serves as 2 good life lessons for the audience.

1. If you are ending your engagement, do it in person. C'mon, it's not like you saw the person for dinner twice. You are ENGAGED, the guy got a ring and a house for you.
2. Don't end relationships because you think the other person is not going to like/stand something. She hurt someone that really liked her, lost something that could have been an amazing relationship, just because she didn't ask him what he wanted.

Midget's standup and being fired: WHOA. Yeah, the moment Reggie told her to talk about Shy, everyone saw that coming... That finale was heartbreaking, and now I'm very curious to see what's going to happen in the next season.

Regarding the last scene, I'll leave this Reddit comment here
