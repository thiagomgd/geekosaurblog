Time to talk about book I'm reading. On thing that I'm trying to do is have a few 'active' books, so I can have a change. Also, I'm trying to split my reads in 3 categories: fiction, non-fiction, and learning. The list below is a good example of that.

## Main Read: Let's Pretend This Never Happened: A Mostly True Memoir by Jenny Lawson

This is what I'm reading the most right now. It's life stories from Jenny Lawson, and they are truly entertaining. The way she writes is hilarious, and also touching. I read Furiously Happy before (her second book) and absolutely loved it. I'm currently at around 70%, and hope to finish it this weekend.

## Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki, Vol. 4

I'm not reading this that much right now, because I'm more focused on Let's Pretend This Never Happened. I had a lot of fun with the first 3 volumes on this series, having pre-ordered books 2 to 4 as soon as I finished the current volume. But I guess at some point any light novel has the risk of turning a bit repetitive. I just hope that's not the case and that Tomozaki continues to evolve and face new obstacles.

As for learning book, I'm occasionally reading The Making of a Manager, something to learn about a possible future career path.
