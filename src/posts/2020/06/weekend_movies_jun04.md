My parents and I decided to watch some movies, instead of starting a new TV show, so we can enjoy the last few days of Telecine's free trial. Check below what we watched this weekend!

## Where'd You Go, Bernadette

Nice family movie for everyone. My favorite of the 3 I've watched this weekend. A nice mix of comedy, drama, and family love. Recommended!

> When architect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox goes missing prior to a family trip to Antarctica, her 15-year-old daughter Bee goes on a quest with Bernadette's husband to find her.

## The Professor and the Madman

Not much to say about this one, but it as very interesting to see how much work was needed to create a dictionary, and how much the academics struggled to make it happen.

> Professor James Murray begins work compiling words for the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary in the mid 19th century, and receives over 10,000 entries from a patient at Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, Dr. William Minor.

## Fighting With My Family

This is a nice movie about Paige, the youngest WWE Diva champion. If you liked the wrestling aspect, I also strongly suggest watchin Netflix's series GLOW! You can also follow Paige on Twitter: [@RealPaigeWWE](//twitter.com/RealPaigeWWE).

> Born into a tight-knit wrestling family, Paige and her brother Zak are ecstatic when they get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try out for the WWE. But when only Paige earns a spot in the competitive training program, she must leave her loved ones behind and face this new cutthroat world alone. Paige's journey pushes her to dig deep and ultimately prove to the world that what makes her different is the very thing that can make her a star.
