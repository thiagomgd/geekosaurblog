As I mentioned in the last post, my parents and I decided to watch more movies before starting a new series. Here are the movies I've watched with them, along with a couple series we watched.

## Movies

### Booksmart

Teen comedy movie. Nothing laugh-out-loud, but definitely cool for a Friday night!

> Two academic teenage superstars realize, on the eve of their high school graduation, that they should have worked less and played more. Determined to never fall short of their peers, the girls set out on a mission to cram four years of fun into one night.

### Proud Mary

Nice to see a female lead shooting everyone! Recommended

> Mary is a hit woman working for an organized crime family in Boston, whose life is completely turned around when she meets a young boy whose path she crosses when a professional hit goes bad.

### Braven

Nothing special, but good enough to spend some time, grab popcorn, and enjoy.

> A logger defends his family from a group of dangerous drug runners.

### Going in Style

Based on a movie from 1979 ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_in_Style)), this is a crime/comedy movie with a lot of heart. Seeing someone who has to rob a bank makes me root even more for then than Ocean's Eleven, for example. Really fun and recommended.

> Desperate to pay the bills and come through for their loved ones, three lifelong pals risk it all by embarking on a daring bid to knock off the very bank that absconded with their money.

## TV Shows

### History 101 - Season 1

This is a really cool Netflix documentary series, each 20 minutes episode telling us a bit of contemporary history. The themes go from fast food to nuclear energy, feminism and the space race. A must watch if you want some easy-to-digest information.

> Infographics and archival footage deliver bite-size history lessons on scientific breakthroughs, social movements and world-changing discoveries.

### The Good Place - Season 4

I didn't know that The Good Place's 4th season was alread available on Netflix Brazil. I'm watching this by myself. 

> Eleanor Shellstrop is an ordinary woman who, through an extraordinary string of events, enters the afterlife where she comes to realize that she hasn't been a very good person. With the help of her wise afterlife mentor, she's determined to shed her old way of living and discover the awesome (or at least the pretty good) person within.
