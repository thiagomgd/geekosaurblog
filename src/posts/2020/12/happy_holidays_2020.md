I haven't been writing much recently, but I still want to wish everyone a happy new year! I was going to wish everyone a merry Christmas, but seems I'm a bit late on that.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to be very active here this year, specially this month, but I hope I can post more starting January. Even if that means keeping it simple and short.

On Christmas eve my wife and I enjoyed a nice bottle of wine, and watched Happiest Season on Prime Video. It's a lot of fun, with many cool actors. Great for a post-Christmas-dinner chill.

And that's all for today. Hope everyone is having a nice time and enjoying what's left of 2020. And to a great 2021!
