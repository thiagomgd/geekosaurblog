title: Too Many Returning Shows, Skipping Them All
thumbnail:
---

The first part of Stranger Things season 4 is here, and The Boys is returning in a week. Many other shows also returned recently and how am I dealing with it? Not watching any of those at all.

It’s not that I don’t want to watch them, but it’s just too much, and I guess I’m not in the mood for those most of the time.
