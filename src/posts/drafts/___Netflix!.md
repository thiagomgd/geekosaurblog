This week we have some news about Netflix. They are:

- Netflix loses subscribers for the first time in 10+ years ([article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/19/netflix-nflx-earnings-q1-2022.html), [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31088353));
- Netflix shares drop 26% after it loses 200K subscribers ([article](https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-50face93d2d2a876fa5485500e3d360a), [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31089802))
- Netflix to introduce ad-supported plan (article, HN discussion)
- Netflix hints at password sharing crackdown as subscribers fall ([article](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61153252), [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31095078))

Now, pairing those news with ‘older’ news and online discussions and complaints I see from time to time, I guess a lot of dissatisfaction if justified here, to an extent.

## Password Sharing

Let me start by saying: password sharing is wrong. But we do need to think about why some people do it, and maybe what could be done to improve the situation, along with recognizing that this is probably not going away completely. If password sharing is completely impossible, people will probably revert back to pirating.

Some reasons why we password share: the most obvious, it’s cheaper to pay for the 4 screen plan than for 4x1 screen plan. Second, many people justify it because they don’t watch it that much - so it’s kind of a problem with the catalog. And the third reason, that I think justifies the whole thing, is that to get 4k video, you basically need to pay for the package with 4 screens. In my house, it’s just me and my wife, we don’t watch much, and never watch concurrently. So yeah... not going to pay the most expensive package with 4 screens for our usage. But I also refuse to not have good quality video and audio.
