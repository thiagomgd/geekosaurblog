Every time I pass by a bookstore, I end up taking pictures of dozens of books that seem interesting. *Yeah, I'm judging books by the cover, feel free to judge me*. So here are some things I saw at today's stop at Indigo.

### YA 

I actually saw A Study In Drowning on the kobo store at some point but forgot about it. The cover is gorgeous and the hardcover version feels like something that would be nice to have. But... I don't have space anymore and dark academia YA is really tricky. Might check it later this year if I'm in the mood

Curious Tides seems interesting, and it's also a YA dark academia book. A bit of a coincidence?

The Scarlet Alchemist is the first in a duology, which can be good. Might get back to this when I'm in the mood for some Chinese fantasy!

## Adult

Starling House is cursed town, haunted house. I guess I will have to read it at some point
