It's been a while since I posted anything here, specially something that's not Geekosaur News. So let's have a look at new books I got recently!

In the past couple months, I got those 8 new books on Kobo:
- Daughter of Sparta by Claire Andrews
- Until The End Of Time by Brian Greene
- Castle In The Air by Donald E. Westlake
- Killers of a Certain Age by Deanna Raybourn
- We Are Never Meeting in Real Like by Samantha Irby
- A Natural History of Dragons by Marie Brennan
- Perry Rhodan NEO 3 by Michael Marcus Thurner and Frank Borsch
- Episode Thirteen by Craig DiLouie

And today I also ended up getting the L. E. Modesitt, Jr. Humble Bundle by TOR books. It has 2 complete series: Recluce and Corean Chronicles, and also five sci-fi books. I'm interested in the Corean Chronicles, let's see if I can get to it soon-ish.

I read a bit of Perry Rhodan NEO vol. 3, but paused it because my parents arrive to visit, and now that they went back home I was just not in the mood for it, so I went back to Durarara! Vol. 1, which I read just the first chapter quite some time ago.

I'm not sure what I'm reading next, but if non-fiction, it's going to be Brian Greene's Until The End of Time.
