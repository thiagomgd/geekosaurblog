A long time and a few blogs ago, I used to post Friday Finds, a tag where people posted cool new things they found. Mostly used for new titles that people discovered and added to their TBR list.

So, here are some books that I saw this week and got interested in. Except for the first one, all were seen in my last visit to the bookstore. The first I saw someone mentioning online, and it's still in pre-order.

## The Lake House (Sarah Beth Durst)

I've read Drink, Slay, Love many years ago, and it's still a book that I will occasionally remember. So, when I saw that the same author was doing a "_Yellowjackets meets One of Us Is Lying_" fantasy book, I got instantly interested. I'm not big on YA, but I'll keep an eye on this one. Or maybe even pre-order the print edition since it looks GORGEOUS.

##  Wild And Wicked Things (Francesca May)

Great Gatsby but as sapphic gothic horror? I'm in! This was on Indigo's Staff Picks selection, and I actually saw this book a while ago there, but this renewed my interest. Probably going to get it :)

## Unseelie (Ivelisse Housman)

Took a pic because of the real nice cover, but I just saw that it has an autistic character, and it's written by an autistic writer. AND it's a duology. Did I ever tell you how much I hate that everything is a trilogy or longer series, and how much duologies needs more love?

This is so cool!! _*adds it to store cart_

## Monstrous Heart (Claire McKenna)

My wife pointed those 3 BEAUTIFUL covers at the bookstore. And seems to blend a bunch of stuff that I'm into. Also, good to read something on sea/water, instead of on land.
