A couple weeks ago I posted some [anticipated YA book releases for 2023](https://geekosaur.com/post/2023-anticipated-books-ya/). Now I'm back with a few more genres. Yeah, I know it's LATE for this kind of list, but here I'm anyway.

All books come from the following Goodreads lists:
- [Horror Novels](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/2507-the-most-anticipated-horror-novels-of-2023)
- [Mysteries](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/2440-2023-s-most-anticipated-mysteries-thrillers)
- [Fantasy & Sci-Fi](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/2514-2023-s-most-anticipated-new-fantasy-and-science-fiction)

## Horror

We have two Silvia Moreno-Garcia book releases. They are kind of an instant TBR add. The first one, _Our Share of Night_, is a queer novel about vampires, and the one I'm most excited for. _Silver Nitrate_ is a historical magical-realism story about making an horror movie.

_Our share of night is actually already released, BUT that's just because I'm late to this list, so I'll cheat?_

_Tell Me I'm Worthless_ is a sapphic (and transgender) horror book, with a HUGE plus that it's adult fiction, and not YA - nothing agains it, I absolutely loved Sawkill Girls, but it's just that most hyped sapphic horror seems to be all YA, so I'm glad for that! It's also short - only 259 pages!

_Episode Thirteen_ is about ghost hunting, which is something that is always interesting.

_A House with Good Bones_ is a southern-gothic. I don't remember reading any southern horror, so I guess it's nice to add to a "maybe I'll read that" list

## Mystery

_Vera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murderers_: this title is basically my wife watching any crime drama or movie. Yeah, she is always pointing out how the assassin is screwing up when I'm watching Columbo, haha

_Of Manners and Murder: A Dear Miss Hermione Mystery_ is another cozy mystery, and this time, a historical mystery set in 1885 London. It sounds interesting, and blends two of my favorite mystery sub-genres, so it's a win in my book!

## Fantasy & Sci-Fi

_Immortal Longings_: I saw this one in one of Daniel Greene's video, where we showing the GORGEOUS cover.

And even better: it's adult fantasy :). I saw that there's an Indigo Exclusive version listed on the author's website, but Indigo is partially offline now, so I can't see it :/ 

The only sad thing is that the best cover is for the UK release, and not US-Canada. Whyyyyyy? I guess I'll have to import that one if I decide to get it in print.

_The Archive Undying_: The premise reads: "_War machines and AI gods run amok inÂ **The Archive Undying**_".  I guess I _had to_ add it to my potential TBR?
