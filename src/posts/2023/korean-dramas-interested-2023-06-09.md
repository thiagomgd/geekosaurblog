June is here, my interest in Korean dramas is here, so let's make a small list of shows premiering this month that are on my radar!

![](img/korean-dramas-interested-2023-06-09.png)

## Lies Hidden in My Garden (ENA, Jun 19, 2023 - Jul 11, 2023)

A SHORT drama. I love it already!

Jokes aside, this drama seems interesting, and it's something a bit more serious and dark. Hope it's dark like Strangers From Hell! ([MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/740197-a-house-with-a-yard), [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/lies-hidden-in-my-garden))

> An ordinary housewife's life goes in an unexpected direction after noticing a strange smell in her backyard

## Revenant (SBS, Jun 23, 2023 - Jul 29, 2023)

Trailer seems interesting, and it's been a minute I watched something like this. Episodes are on the longer side (70 min.), but it's only 12 episodes, so that sounds appealing to me too! ([MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/717539-the-devil), [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/revenant))

> An occult mystery thriller in which a woman possessed by a demon and a man who can see the demon uncover mysterious deaths surrounding five bodies.

## Heartbeat (KBS2, Jun 26, 2023 - Aug 15, 2023)

I like vampire stories, and having a comedy with a half-vampire seems pretty cool! Will def. give it a try at least. ([MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/746637-my-heart-beats), [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/heartbeat-2023))

> Half-human and half-vampire Seon Woo-hyeol, who was unable to become human due to a one day difference amidst 100 years, starts to live together with Joo In-hae, a woman who has no humane side, and find true warmth.
