I should have done this sooner, but here it is: a look at those "Most Anticipated Books" lists. This time checking some 2023 YA releases that I might like. 

Will do other categories (Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi) later on. This is comes from [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/2510-2023-s-most-anticipated-young-adult-books)

_Immortality: A Love Story (by Dana Schwartz)_ is the second volume in the _The Anatomy_ duology. I read the first volume and thought it was good, so I already went ahead and pre-ordered the hardcover for this new one so I have the complete set on print.

_Wildblood (by Lauren Blackwood)_ is a historical fantasy set in a Jamaican jungle? How NOT to be interested on that? Personally I would prefer this to not be YA, but if they don't go too hard on extra romance/romantic triangle, it can be GREAT!

_She Is a Haunting (by Trang Thanh Tran)_ is targeted towards Mexican Gothic fans. Add to that the Vietnam setting, Ghosts, Paranormal, Queer hashtags, and yeah, I'll be reading this one. Just need to decide if physical or eBook.

_Nightbirds (by Kate J. Armstrong)_ also sounds pretty interesting, and yeah, it's another queer historical fantasy. This one sounds very interesting, but being the first in a series, I might end up passing on it. Maybe I'll keep an eye on it and get the whole thing after the series is done?

_Flowerheart (by Catherine Bakewell)_ is a queer cottagecore fantasy cozy mystery??? I'm  intrigued by this one, and it's a standalone, so I'll keep an eye on it.

_Zhara (by S. Jae-Jones)_ is marketed as Sailor Moon meets Cinder. It's high-fantasy, asian literature, and... magical girls? And with THAT cover. I'll see how this goes, and how many books are planned - since I don't wanna start long series for quite some time.
