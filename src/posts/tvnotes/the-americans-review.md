Now premiering its 4th season, The Americans is always proving itself as a great, insightful and thought-provoking show. After a long time without any major spy shows (that I remember, at least), The Americans is good and strong enough to, hopefully, star a new wave of TV spy dramas.

Since its very first episode, we got to see the some of the darker aspects of being trained and sent to field on enemy territory. Of course, sex, secrets and intrigue are part of the menu, but the enemies aren't the only ones affected. After more than a decade working undercover on the US, Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Phillip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) need to create excuses for their children, Henry (Keidrich Sellati) and Paige (Holly Taylor). They need to balance their secret lives with their daily jobs, taking care of the kids and maintaining a good relationship with one of the neighbors, Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) who's an FBI agent.  

We also see how their jobs and obligations with mother Russia and their children affect them, and they have to work hard not to mix everything with the little romantic relationship they have. sometimes. Speaking about children and neighbors, they also play a big part here. We see how's everything going at Stan's work, drawing a parallel and giving the viewer insights on what the next attack will be. It's also great to see how Paige is growing smarter and more aware of the strange situations involving their parents.

This show has multiple viewpoints at the same time and deals with it in a superb manner. It's been a long time since I've been so much involved and attached to the characters on a TV show, and with The Americans, I'm always cheering for everyone. I'm currently in the middle of the 3rd season and hope to catch up quickly. There's still time to start watching it, because once you start, you'll binge whole seasons like there's no tomorrow.
