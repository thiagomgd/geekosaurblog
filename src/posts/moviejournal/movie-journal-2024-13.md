Last week of March, a few more Giallo movies, but also a musical comedy to wrap up the month! (*Last week I didn't watch anything, that's why no recap*)

**The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh (1971)**: Another Edwige Fennech movie, this one was better than the previous couple movies I watched. I was expecting it to be a bit more risqu√© than it was, considering the title and cover, but I do think the movie had a good balance between skin, murder and mystery. Solid recommendation for a giallo fan.

**The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970)**: Solid movie, even though I enjoyed it slightly less than The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh. No skin here, but plenty of mystery and it had a scary vibe, so no complains at all. Another great rec, specially for people that prefer movies with no/less nudity.

**The Pajama Game (1957)**: decided to end up the week (and month) with something lighter, and this musical is lighthearted, fun, and has a bunch of cool songs!
