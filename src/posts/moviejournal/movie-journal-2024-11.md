This week I continued with the Giallo movies. I was originally thinking I would watch more old horror movies, random old bad movies, or old noir, but in the end, I was just down this rabbit hole.

Watched 3 movies, in 'ascending order' or release date, and 'descending order' of rating and enjoyment. Still happy to have watched them though.

**The Case of the Bloody Iris (1972)**: This one has a longer Italian name that translates as “*Why those weird drops of blood on Jennifer's body?*”, which is quite interesting. The movie features Edwige Fenech, which is probably going to be sort of a constant presence here considering the number of films she was in.

I really enjoyed the investigation aspect of this movie, and the detective should get a show of his own - or a bunch of Giallo movies. 

**All the Colours of the Dark (1976)**: another Edwige Fenech movie, but this one I didn’t enjoy as much as other Giallo I watched recently. I think this is due to the movie focusing on her character, but not having any investigation going on. 

The plot is interesting but felt like something was missing. The main character seemed to jump too quickly into just going to a black mass with unknown people. 

**The Sister of Ursula** (1978): this was ok, and a little bit of an odd one. A sleazy Giallo that does murder and sex scenes, but in a way that one detracts the other, instead of making the whole even better.

The soundtrack was more like an Emmanuelle movie than a murder mystery. The was a big amount of skin, and if you look away for a couple minutes, you are probably missing some nudity. Still happy I gave it a try
