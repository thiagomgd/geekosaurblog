**Blood And Black Lace**: Strong start to the week, definitely a great Giallo movie. A bunch of suspects for the murders, great plot overall and I had a great time with it.

**Tenebrae**: I usually like when stories involve book authors, and this one was no exception. It does have a nice twist and, while you can at some point guess who's partly behind it, it is not predictable.

**Phenomena (Creepers)**: This was in my list for a while and I finally watched it. It was fun and way less gory and scary than I thought - still a bit gross on the last 15 minutes ðŸ˜…. Jennifer Connelly is great and it was cool to see one of her earlier works. I guess I still want to go through other movies with her from the 80s and 90s. The soundtrack is also great!!
