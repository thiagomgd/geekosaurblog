**The Boy and the Heron (2023)**: after years without going to the theatre, went with my wife and friends. Definitely worth it! As many Miyazaki movies, it has a bit of adventure, is a bit trippy and makes you think about the meanings of the movies events and characters. That was another reminder that I need to watch more Ghibli.

**House of the Long Shadows (1983)**: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and John Carradine in the same movie? Count me in. This one was a lot of fun, keeping my interested during it and had some nice twists at the end.

**Comedy of Terrors (1964)**: this plot!!! It was something I would imagine seeing in a manga/anime too. It was funny and refreshing. Nice to watch Vincent Price and Peter Lorre together (with them, I also recommend The Raven).

*I discovered the [Cats On Film](https://catsonfilm.net/2013/01/20/cat-of-the-day-092/) and [Cinemacats](https://cinemacats.com/the-comedy-of-terrors-1963/) blogs.*

**The Red Queen Kills Seven Times (1972)**: my second Barbara Bouchet giallo, after Amuck. It was a nice one, with cool story and twist.
