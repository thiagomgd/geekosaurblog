This weekend I went to VanCaf ([Vancouver Comic Arts Festival](https://www.vancaf.org/)) and had a great time there. Saw (and bought) a lot of cool art, and one of the things I saw there were King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard’s records with covers by [Eden Cooke](https://edencooke.com/). 

This is a band that every once in a while pops up on my Youtube suggestions, or on other social media, and finally I decided to give it a try, and guess what? They are so cool! When we went back to the event again on Sunday, I decided to grab a record for me, and ended up getting the last one!!

Enough talk, let’s check the music!!!
