Iâ€™m watching Wednesday with my wife, and one of the things that Iâ€™m enjoying is the soundtrack. Not only is the original score neat, but it also features some cool versions of songs like Paint It Black and Nothing Else Matters.

From the very beginning of the show, we have Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien from Edith Piaf, which is always a pleasure to listen to

We also have this really cool Paint It Black version. And the scene is also just great!

Episode 3 has Nothing Else Matters - Couldnâ€™t find the actual scene on YT ðŸ˜•

And the OST was composed by Danny Elfman and Chris Bacon
