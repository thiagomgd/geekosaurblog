Lately I've been buying some CDs and cassettes, and also trying to organize my steaming music a bit more, creating some playlists and "mixtapes".

Let's have a look at new music I got, what I've been listening to, and new bands I discovered!

## Mixtapes
So, they are not physical tapes (yet), but I've been trying to create mixtapes online, putting a bit more effort into making selections, having a time limit. I think that's nicer than having just a few playlists that are several hours long.
For today, I have something I created after seeing some fun videos on TikTok about polyJAMorous (like, listening to different styles of music). It's not as diverse as I would like, but let's see how the next one will play out. The theme for this one is "earworm", songs that will get stuck on your head!
