Recently I got a new record: Sam Smith live at Abbey Road Studios. I like Sam Smith, but absolutely loved this album. Those versions are cleaner - for lack of a better word - and delightful to listen to. Then I discovered that it's also available on Netflix for everyone to watch, so I say: go there and check it out!

A couple are available on Youtube, which you can check below!
