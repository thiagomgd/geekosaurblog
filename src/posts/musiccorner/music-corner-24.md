## New Physical Media

My wife got tickets for Avril's concert, so I got her Let Go on CD! Also got Paramore's self titled album on CD.

## New Artists/Albums Listened

**Patti Smith**: I haven't heard of Patti Smith before, but my sister-in-law mentioned it when she was here, because she had read her biography, so we listened to a few songs. I have to say it's pretty good! We just listened on shuffle so I don't remember which songs/album

**Lana Del Rey - Ocean Blvd**: it's a good album, and has great songs. BUT, I'm not too fond of the intermissions, and I think that for me, they take away from the listening experience. I was a bit excited for it and planning on maybe getting it on CD, but I guess I'll just skip it.

**Dorothy - Through The Years and Gifts From The Holy Ghost: Had some good time listening to those 2 albums. **Through The Years** is a digital only best-of compilation from 2023, and **Gifts From The Holy Ghost** is the latest actual album, from 2022. I did prefer Through The Years, which I guess makes sense since it's a compilation of notable songs, but kinda wish it was available in physical format.

**The Pretty Reckless - Other Worlds and Death By Rock'n'Roll**: Other Worlds isa great compilation, with acoustic recordings, covers and reimaginings. Death By Rock'n'Roll is also a pretty fun album, but overall, I think I prefer Other Worlds for the variety + acoustics. (I bought Other Worlds BTW).

**Molly Burch - Daydreamer**: I have this on cassette, and had some fun time listening to it while reading

Rhapsody Of Fire re-records https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n44oeVOgTEYP0vm8e47ARrCOrzBaCGSQ0

This is so nostalgic. I think I haven't listened to them since they were still called Rhapsody. Great album, and I just love their first 4 albums. I guess I need to have a listen to their new stuff soon.

Mariah Carey MTV Unplugged - https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m7hLInIKFoX297x5lVqXdcHBYhTW6352A 

This live is just so good, and early 1990s Mariah just rocks so much!

## MVs
I also listened quite a bit to (G)I-DLE, and had their MVs running during work. Their new song and MV, Wife, is pretty cool! Loved the aesthetic and dance.

## Lives

Teddy pendergrass: This 1979 live concert is just so good!! Love Teddy's voice, and he's opening with an absolute banger!
