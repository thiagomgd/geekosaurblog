Last Music Corner of the month, this time with a few K-Pop Live videos I saw on my Mastodon timeline.

Loved the live band arrangements on all performances. I'm not familiar with the singers and songs here to compare with the studio versions - will probably check those later - but those sound really nice!

Starting with a couple Lee Hi performances shared in [this post](https://mastodon.social/@sariash/109768480721831003):

And on the post above, [this other post](https://mastodon.social/@heyminto/109768371358638115) is mentioned, and it shares a couple Kwon EunBi live performances that are also cool.
