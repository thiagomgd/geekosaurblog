## New Music

My wife and sister-in-law were at Urban Outfitters and saw CHAI's album on sale for CAD$10. The record looks so cool, and it has a poster, and a signed postcard.

## Cool Listens, New To Me

**Eliana Cuevas - Ser√© Libre (feat. Angel Falls Orchestra)**: Saw an album from her on a record store, and decided to check her out when I got home. Great surprise!

**Camila Cabello - Familia**: an album with some great songs but that unfortunately, has a few totally skippable. The worst thing is that, feels like the songs I didn't like would be so much better with just a different accompaniment/instrumental. *Quiet* and *Boys Don't Cry* were a combo of too much bass for me, which is a shame because those those are between *La Buena Vida* and *Hasta Los Dientes*, which are great! I guess I basically just want her tiny desk concert.

**Caroline Polachek - Desire, I Want To Turn Into You**: Cool album cover, and my sister-in-law said she likes her, so I gave it a go!

**Kelly Clarkson - Chemistry**: I've never listened to any album from her, back-to-back. But decided to give it a go, specially after seeing her Vampire cover a while back. This album is pretty good, and her vocals are, as always, freaking great.
