If you have played a few different tabletop games (boardgames, card, etc), you probably had a game session that was not good. But it wasn't bad because you lost, or the game was too simple or complex, short or long. Instead it was boring because you just were... not doing anything.

I've played games in many different categories, play styles, lengths and complexity levels, and there's a popular game that although I like it generally, has a fatal flaw that sometimes just ruins my day: Catan.

*If you are not familiar with Catan, a 1 paragraph explanation: to build things and get points, you need different resources. You get resources if for a dice roll, you have a settlement or city near a resource with that number - and the robber is not there. You also lose resources if you have too many cards and a 7 is rolled, or someone robs from you after rolling a 7.*

The rules seem simple enough: getting resources is a combination of good placement (skill and luck), dice rolls (luck), and not being attacked by the robber - your "friends" - (not being the lead + luck + people not hating you or wanting you to have a bad time I guess?).

Having luck playing a role in a tabletop game is normal, and most games rely on it on different levels. This affects how much a game is skill-only based, thus being perfect for competitions and hardcore players who wanna prove they are the best, or something more beginner or family/work friendly, where you can introduce your favorite game and everybody's going to have a good time.

There is an important point to make: people play games in different occasions and for different reasons. I usually play to have fun with my friends, have a beer, enjoy my time. So in a game or Catan or Ticket To Ride, I'll not always make the choice that's going to make me win. 

Blocking a track on Ticket To Ride just so the other player can't complete their route - as we sometimes call intentional blocking - is definitely going to ruin the fun for the other player. Constantly attacking the same player, denying all their trade requests and so off on Catan, is also going to make it for a bad experience for them.

So, what's Catan's "great sin"? As I mentioned in the opening, the problem is when you are not actually playing, not doing anything, just because for 15 minutes you were not able to get resource to either build a settlement, upgrade to a city, build a road or a ship... literally anything! And believe, that happens.

*I do feel that Seafarers and Cities & Knights suffer way less from this problem than the base game. Maybe a point for a future post?*
