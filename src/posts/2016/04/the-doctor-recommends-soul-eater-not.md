I admit that I never read or watched Soul Eater, although I want to, 
but I don't see this changing because it's a long manga/anime series. 
But this spin-off is a good way to experience the world created by Atsushi Ohkubo. 
It has only 5 volumes/12 episodes, and it's lovely and fun.

__Disclaimer: this post is about the manga. I only watched the first episode of the anime, 
because now I don't want to watch something that I already know the end.__

## What's good about it

The art is really nice. There's a little bit of fanservice, but nothing to worry about. 
Ohkubo's art translates the characters emotions well, and it's a pleasure to look at it. 
The character's are not the most original, but they are deep enough for a manga that's meant to be 
more focused on humor and the daily lives at the Academy. 
I had good times following Tsugumi, Meme, and Anya interactions between themselves 
and the other students and citizens of Death City.

## I recommend it to

- People who are into slice-of-life and school life comedies
- People who want something short and beautiful, for some laughs and a warm story about friendship

## I don't recommend it to

- People who want a lot of fights and blood and swearing. This is a funny and light manga.
- People who get angry or upset by a minimum of fanservice
