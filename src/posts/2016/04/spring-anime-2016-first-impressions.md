It's time for another first impressions post, with my reviews about Spring 2016 anime that I watched. 
Between brackets is the number of episodes I've watched so far / Total.

## Boku no Hero Academia (3/13)

The highest hype of this season proved to be great indeed: story, characters, animation, everything. 
If you like shounen, fights, and a story of a kid turning into a hero, this one is for you!

## Flying Witch (2/12)

A beautiful and cozy slice-of-life anime, featuring a lovely witch as the main character. 
She doesn't have any sense of direction, is kind of clueless sometimes, but has a big heart and good intentions. 
It's nice watching her interactions with the other characters. If you want to just sit back and relax, watch it!

## Koutetsujou no Kabaneri / Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (1/??)

I never watched Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack on Titan, but Kabaneri seems to be the same kind of anime. 
But it has a steampunk setting (which I love) and great colors. 
Watch if you like people running for their lives, fleeing from monsters.

## Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? /  And you thought there is never a girl online? (2/12)

What's the thing with loooooooooooooong LN titles? Anyway, Netoge is kind of fun, but I don't know if I'll keep watching. 
For now, I'll watch a couple more episodes and then decide if it's worth the time.

## Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu / Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- (2/25)

There's a flood of 'sent to another world' light novel based anime, and usually, I won't commit to 25 episodes of this, 
but Re:Zero seems to be an interesting mix of other anime, delivering some entertaining episodes until now (the first episode was 40 min. long). 
I really hope that this show doesn't fall into just tropes and clich√©s, but after Grimgar and Konosuba, I have hope.

NOTE: [both the light novel and the manga are available for pre-order](http://amzn.to/241JkrT)

## Bungou Stray Dogs (2/12)

This one is nice, but I have to admit that, even though it's good (and hyped), 
there's a slight chance that I'll drop it. The plot and setting are really interesting, 
but so far the execution isn't great. I'll give it 2 more episodes to see where they're going.

## Macross Delta (2/??)

This isn't Macross Plus (which I loved), but it's good anyway. 
Seems to have a lighter mood and to be more focused on the music, 
and that's fine because I was thinking about watching Love Live! or another girl group anime. 
It's really cute and entertaining, and so far I'm liking it.

## Sakamoto desu ga? / Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto (1/13)

This is the kind of show that you either love or hate because it's a type of humor and jokes that don't appeal to everyone. 
I liked the first episode and I hope that the novelty doesn't wear off.

## Uchuu Patrol Luluco (2/13)

A crazy fun short anime. For now, I'm going to keep watching it!

## Mayoiga / The Lost Village (1.5/12)

I had high expectations for this one, but halfway through the second episode,
 I still not had any connection with any of the characters. Maybe after the season is over, 
 I'll check some reviews and decide to watch the rest or not, but for now, I'm gonna pass.

## Sousei no Onmyouji / Twin Star Exorcists (0.5/12)

It's interesting, really, but it didn't get my attention and didn't stand out. 
I'll wait a little bit more to see how the reviews go.

## Haifuri

Another one that I'm interested into, but don't know if it's worth or not.

## Kuma Miko

I'll watch this one with my girlfriend, but we didn't start it yet.
