Last week I decided to give Wynonna Earp a try. After the first episode premiered, the poor IMDB and Trakt.tv ratings 
made me put this show aside. But then I read some reviews, stumbled over twitter reactions, and thought: 
"Why not? It's the kind of show I usually love". I happened to love it, and I guess sometimes we learn (or remember) 
a life lesson, and this time, it's about not trusting online ratings for TV shows.

> Wynonna Earp follows Wyatt Earp's great granddaughter as she battles demons and other creatures. 
With her unique abilities, and a posse of dysfunctional allies, she's the only thing that can bring the paranormal to justice.

Wynonna Earp is a show based on a weird western comic book, and it was made to be fun. 
I guess that's the reason of many of the poor ratings because, at least for me, it achieved its goal. 
I can't remember the last time I watched a weird western show, 
let alone one with a faulty female character that loves to drink and make dirty jokes using some interesting phrasing.

It also features a lesbian cop that's interested in Wynonna's sister, Waverly, Wyatt Earp's BFF Doc Holliday, 
and a super cold detective. I have to admit that I (along with other people) dislike Agent Xavier Dolls. 
He's really a pain. But I think (hope) that they'll make him more believable and likeable in the future episodes.

So, if you want to try something that's plain fun with a setting that's different from the rest 
(a contemporary weird western), watch the first episodes of Wynonna Earp. You might fall in love with it!
