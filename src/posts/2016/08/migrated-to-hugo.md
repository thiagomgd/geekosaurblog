As you may have noticed, the layout changed. It this is not about layout, but about the server and system used to 
generate and display the site to you.

I always had a few problems with Blogger, like the image margins it insists on putting, not being able to use paragraphs, 
and much more. Another issue, of course, is owning and having a copy of my own content. 
If they decide to delete my account, my blog is completely gone! Then, I decided to start using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Hugo is a static website generator. It's not supposed to create web apps, for example, 
but it's more than enough for a blog. Now, I'm able to control how my pages are created, 
and how and where they are hosted. For instance, I'm using Amazon S3 to host the content, 
and Gulp to pre-process and upload it. For now, it's being really great to me. I don't want to delve into the 
technical aspects of this change, but if you also want to move from Blogger/Wordpress/Tumblr to Hugo and Amazon S3, 
feel free to leave a comment, and I'll be glad to give you some tips and help you.
