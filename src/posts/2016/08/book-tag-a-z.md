I really suck to answer book (and tv show) tags. I almost never know what to answer. But we have to try, right?
The one is saved as a draft for quite a _looooong_ time, so I don't remember where did I see it. But seems that it
was created by The Perpetual Page Turner, ans you can check out the original post 
[here](http://www.perpetualpageturner.com/2013/08/some-friday-fun.html).

<!--more-->

### Author you've read the most

Arthur Conan Doyle.


### Best sequel ever

Difficult to decide, but I think that the Herry Potter series evolved with every book. 
Other series that had great sequels: Skulduggery Pleasant, Liebermann Papers and The Assassin's Curse. 
_Does Sherlock Holmes' books count as sequels? If yes, they're my choice here_

### Currently reading

Shadow Scale (Seraphina #2), by Rachel Hartman.

### Drink of choice while reading

Coffee and Tea.

### E-reader or physical book?

Physical because I can touch and have them on my shelves, with their beautiful covers, but eBooks have their advantages :smile: 

### Fictional character you probably would have actually dated in High School

No one #ForeverAlone =/

### Glad you gave this book a chance

### Kind of book you won't read

Christian fiction.

### Longest book you've read

I think it's Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien, but not sure. I've read a few long books,
like Liebermann Papers' and The Dinosaur Lords, but never compared the page count. Guess I'm not too curious about this.

### Major book hangover because of

I can't remember having any.

### Number of bookcases you own

None. I use my sister's wardrobe (she doesn't live with us anymore), and a cabinet in my room.

### One book you've read multiple times

Julius Cesar. But I can't remember which one, and damn, I want to re-read it again now. =/

### Preferred place to read

My bed.

### Quote that inspires you / gives you all the feels from a book you've read

Good question, but I don't have a good answer.

### Reading regret

No one, I think.

### Series you started and need to finish

Skulduggery Pleasant, by Derek Landy and Liebermann Papers by Frank Tallis. 
(I'm not counting Perry Rhodan, because it's humanly impossible to finish it.)

### Unapologetic fanboy for

Perry Rhodan, a German book series by various authors. It's SO damn long. See it by yourself

### Very excited for this release more than all the others

The only one that I'm waiting for is Furthermore, by Tahereh Mafi. Look at how gorgeous the cover is!!!

### Worst bookish habit

Flipping through the book and seeing what will happen next. At least that doesn't happen with eBooks.

### X marks the spot _(start at the top left of your shelf and pick the 27th book)_

Which shelf? My books are scattered :grin:
