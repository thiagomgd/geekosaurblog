Today's recommendation is Saving Mr. Banks, a movie that shows the behind the scenes 
of one of my favorite childhood movies: Mary Poppins

<!--more-->

This movie shows how difficult was for Walt Disney to get Mary Poppins done. After 20 years of persistence, 
P. L. Travers, the book author, finally agrees on doing it. But she has three conditions: it won't be a musical, 
it won't have cartoons, and it won't have Dick van Dyke. 
Moreover, P. L. Travers is not easy to deal, not liking anything or anyone, and is always in a terribly bad mood.

But, in addition to the not-so-pleasant lady, the movie also shows a little girl, many years before, 
dealing with a dad that loved her, but had problems with work and alcohol. 
It all culminates with the arrival of her aunt, who promises to fix everything.

Of course, some facts were omitted or slightly changed, but nevertheless, the film gets to make us know more about the author. 
It's also interesting to know about how the negotiations of characters and franchises can be difficult, even more, when 
the author considers said characters as part of its family. 
And everything is aggravated by the very known distaste the author for all that Disney represents.

Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson did a wonderful job presenting us this antagonistic duo: 
the lively and willing Walt Disney, and the cranky and whiny P. L. Travers. 
My recommendation is that you watch this movie and then rewatch (or watch for the first time) Mary Poppins. 
It's a classic that everyone should watch and revisit sometime.

_Note: after the movie's ending, they show some records of the author's meetings with the studios. Be sure to watch it too!_
