There's still a couple of interesting shows to premiere during August, and here I'm to share it with you! 

<!--more-->

## Victoria - Aug 28, 2016 on ITV

It has Jenna Coleman, it seems to be a great production, and it'll be an 8-part series. 
So I'm going to try it as soon as it premieres.

> The early life of Queen Victoria, from her accession to the throne at the tender age of 18 
through to her courtship and marriage to Prince Albert.

## The Collection - Sep 2, 2016 on Amazon ([Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-collection))

Period drama, fashion, seems to be fine. But I'll wait for some other reviews and first impressions, 
because without any idea if this will be a limited series, or how many episodes the first season will have, 
I just don't feel like adding more commitment to my watchlist. But yes, I hope it's great (and short).

> A gripping family drama and entrepreneurial fable, set in a post-war Paris fashion house. 
It exposes the grit behind the glamour of a rising business, spearheaded by two clashing brothers.
