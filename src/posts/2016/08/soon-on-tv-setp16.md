September is here, and there's a few interesting shows coming. Let's check them below, in order of interest!

<!--more-->

## Van Helsing - Sept. 23 on SyFy

After Wynonna Earp, SyFy delivers another badass female lead series. 
Although not directly related to Zenescope's Van Helsing comic books, unlike Wynonna Earp, 
it's clear that they were inspired by them.

I do have high hopes for this one, and I expect it to be quite an enjoyable ride.

> Vanessa Helsing, distant relative of famous vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing, 
is resurrected only to find that vampires have taken over the world. 
She is humanity's last hope to lead an offensive to take back what has been lost.

## Son of Zorn - Sept. 11 on FOX

Ok, this one can rock or be a total failure. But I'll take a chance and hope that is good. 
After all, I need some 'cartoon' to replace Archer while the next season doesn't start. 
It's not entirely a cartoon, but that'll have to do, and plus, a barbarian puts some D&D feel to it.

> Zorn, the animated warrior, returns to Orange County, CA, to win back his live-action ex-wife Edie and teenage son, Alan.

## The Good Place - Sept. 19 on NBC

I'm not usually in the mood for this kind of comedy, lately. But Ted Danson did a damn fine job at Bored to Death, 
and Kristen Bell is a nice benefit. I'll see how it goes.

{% youtube "2AWeLR-EKAg" %}

> Eleanor Shellstrop is an ordinary woman who, through an extraordinary string of events, 
enters the afterlife where she comes to realize that she hasn't been a very good person. 
With the help of her wise afterlife mentor, 
she's determined to shed her old way of living and discover the awesome (or at least the pretty good) person within.	

## MacGyver - Sept. 23 on CBS

I'm truly afraid that this one will be awful. But still, I didn't watch the original, so I can give this one a chance.

{% youtube "Gt8E6X6-744" %}

> 20-something Angus MacGyver creates a clandestine organization where he uses his knack for solving problems 
in unconventional ways to help prevent disasters from happening.

## Aftermatch - Sept. 27 on SyFy

No comments on this one. I'll have to wait a bit a read some reviews of the first episodes. But it'll be nice if this one is good.

{% youtube "R9N8K9UMYcQ" %}

> The Copelands battle for survival after civilization comes to an apocalyptic end - 
and they are faced not only with plague â€“ but the rise of supernatural creatures.
