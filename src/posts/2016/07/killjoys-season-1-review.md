After finishing [Wynonna Earp's first season](http://www.generalfalcon.com/2016/07/wynonna-earp-season-1-review.html), 
I decided to try Killjoys. I was interested in it before its premiere, but after reading some bad reviews 
I decided not to watch it. Shame on me, trusting online reviews and not watching 
even the first episode to have my own opinion. But then I stumbled upon some good reviews on the first season 
and read a 
[blog post](http://www.bustle.com/articles/168210-will-wynonna-earp-return-for-season-2-watch-these-female-lead-sci-fi-series-while-you-wait-for) 
recommending it, so here I am!

> In the Quad, a planetary system on the brink of a bloody interplanetary class war, 
a fun loving trio of bounty hunters attempt to remain impartial as they chase deadly warrants.

Killjoys is not exactly what you might expect for a SyFy show about a trio of bounty hunters. 
Here, we have a company that rules an entire branch of a galaxy, and what starts as a 'case of the week' show, 
soon develops into a plot that keeps growing, even extending to the second season.

The Company, the RAC, Killjoys, religious people and nobles are all involved in some way with political intrigue, 
conspiracy, and control over the citizens. Each episode gives us a glimpse of what is at stake here, 
and what part each group may be playing.

As for the characters, even some support characters have their time to shine, showing what they're made of, 
and what their motivations are (and this gets way better in the second season). It's really nice to see how 
the main trio (Dutch, John, and D'avin) connects with each other, 
and how they develop and get more depth along the season.

This new wave of SyFy shows seems to have some great shows, and Killjoys is surely one of the must-watchs. 
Having action, a badass female protagonist, great main and supporting characters and an intriguing arc story, 
Killjoys have everything you need to entertain the audience and keep us stuck with it, 
wanting to know what will happen next. The second season started a couple weeks ago, so you have time to catch up :wink:

After watching it, please leave a comment telling me what did you think about it. You can check the show info at
[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3952222/) and
