Father Brown is a TV show based on G. K. Chesterton's eponymous books. 
Featuring a curious and extremely observant parish catholic priest who can't resist the temptation to investigate 
killings carried out in the country. And of course, there's a lot happening around him.

Featuring Mark Williams (yes, Arthur Weasley) as Father Brown, this is your standard Mystery of The Week show. 
But here, instead of presenting us with a high-tech professional team of detectives, 
the show delivers a comically unobtrusive amateur sleuth which the police keeps trying to keep away from the cases. 

But still, Father Brown is persistent at one thing: getting to the truth. He doesn't care about the man's justice system, 
or exactly what the law has to say about it. When it matters the most, Brown, as a priest, trusts that the divine 
judgment will happen. But that does not mean he has a blind faith. 
From time to time, he proves that we have to question what we know about the truth, and about what we believe.

His remarks about science, philosophy, and faith are straight to the point, 
making not only the characters but also the viewers think. 
For him, seems that neither science or religion are always right, 
and I believe that some religious viewers would deeply benefit from this show.

Brown takes advantage of his work to go unnoticed and obtain information and confidences that the police can't. 
Knowing that, he always keeps searching for the truth, no matter how the police, or even the church, 
forbids him to get involved.

The other characters are also great, and the acting, ambiance, and atmosphere of this show are another reason to watch it. 
I have to admit that I didn't read any of Chesterton's books, so I can't compare the two medias, 
but I can say that regardless of the (possible) changes, this is a really fun show to watch. If you want crime solving, 
interesting remarks about the human behavior, good acting, and a nice setting, this one is for you!
