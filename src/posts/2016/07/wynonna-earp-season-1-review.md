This was a show that I was anxious to watch. Based on the eponymous comics, Wynonna Earp promised a fun weird-western 
show, with action and a strong female lead. And it delivered much more than that.

## Story, episodes, and progression

The main premise is what I already talked about on the review of the first episode 
([check HERE](http://www.generalfalcon.com/2016/04/first-impressions-wynonna-earp.html)). 
A Wyatt Earp's descendant discovers that she have to kill ~~zombies~~ revenants, 
outlaws that were originally killed by Wyatt. 
Along with this curse, Wynonna also has to deal with Agent Dolls, Doc Holliday, and a town that doesn't like her.

The first episodes follow the 'mystery/monster of the week' model, while the main story slowly unfolds between us. 
Halfway through the season, it starts focusing more and more on the main heroes and villains, 
with each episode leaving us waiting one week to have some answers, and even more questions. 
I really like the progression of the show, how we connected and related with the characters along the episodes, 
and how we wanted to know more and more about what's happening in Purgatory, 
and what's there besides the curse and the revenants.

The last 2 episodes were incredible, showing us that revenants aren't the only problem Wynonna has to face 
and that we really care about the heroes (#wayhaught).

## Characters, representation, and interaction
Speaking of #Wayhaught, that's what Wynonna Earp did formidably. They didn't just put a lesbian couple onscreen, 
but they were represented with respect, care and in a realistic way. They also interacted with its fanbase, 
sharing art and fiction created by the fandom. Of course, there were a lot of memes and gifs.

But not just Waverly and Haught got attention. Doc and Dolls were also an important part of the show and Wynonna's life. 
We started to cheer for them, and of course, take sides. Both Doc and Dolls had a past that made us curious, 
and we can only imagine what SyFy will do next season.

One-Liners
Another thing that I loved was the humor. Wynonna's interactions with other characters were awesome, 
as well as her jokes and one-liners. Other characters presented us with some laughs too (I'm speaking with you Doc), 
but Melanie Scrofano did an incredible job interpreting Wynonna.

## Conclusion
So, if you want a show that has action, a nice and intriguing story, lovely (and hateful) characters, 
that interacts really well with it's fandom and does a great job representing gay couples and avoiding some 
unfortunate tropes, watch the first season and join us making buzz claiming to get the 2nd season a.s.a.p. 
You'll not regret it.
