> Kouhei Inuzuka is a teacher who has been caring for his little daughter on his own since his wife's death.
He's no good at cooking, so he and his daughter Tsumugi have been eating packaged meals from the convenience store.
A series of events lead him one evening to a restaurant run by the mother of one of his students, Kotori.
Her mother isn't there, but Kotori does her best to feed them both. It turns out Kotori is often alone
since her parents are divorced and her mother is frequently not around.
The three of them begin to meet and cook tasty food together.

This is a manga based anime, set to be 12 episodes long. It's a slice-of-life comedy that, on its first episode,
had heart and charisma, showing the small challenges of being a single father with a young kid.
Kouhei Inuzuka is incapable of cooking, so for 6 months he and Tsumugi only eat packaged meals.
So, in addition to missing her mother, Tsumugi also miss good food, always leaving a rest of her meals.

I really liked how this show uses one smaller problem to show the impacts that the death of the mother has
on the rest of the family. This makes it possible to the show to have a comedic tone, while making us shed a tear 
sometimes. The balance between scenes focused on everyday's life, cooking, cute moments, and emotions make 
Sweetness ad Lightning amazing to watch, and wonderful as a piece of art.

 I hope the show meet my (now high) expectations, and it'll end up being a favorite this season.
