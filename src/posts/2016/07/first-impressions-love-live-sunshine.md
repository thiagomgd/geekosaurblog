Yes. This season I'll be watching Love Live Sunshine. I never watched Love Live or any idol anime before, with the exception of a couple episodes of The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls. And when I decided to watch it, they announced this new installment so I changed my plans and opted for this one instead.

> Uranohoshi Girls' High School, a private school in the seaside neighborhood of 
Uchiura at Numazu city, Shizuoka prefecture.
A small high school in a corner of Suruga Bay, it is home to nine teens, led by second-year student Chika Takami, 
driven by one seriously big dream: To become the next generation of bright, sparkling "school idols"!
As long as we don't give up, any dream can come true... 
All we have to do now is keep pushing hard for fame and glory!
Now their "School Idol Project" begins to make their dreams come true!

Love Live! Sunshine!! doesn't follow the previous seasons' story. Now we have a new school and a new cast, 
but maintaining what made Love Live popular: cute schoolgirls striving to be successful school idols.

This first episode showed Chika Takami, the main girl, trying to start an idol club at her school. 
But with only her as a member, and with a class rep that despises idols, it isn't going to be easy. 
To make things worse, the club has to compose its own songs, 
and the small seaside school doesn't have any student that can do it.

This introductory episode had some cute and funny moments and did a great job getting me hooked up. 
I think that Love Live! Sunshine!! will have some heartful moments, and that it'll provide us a nice season.
