title: My OneNote Dungeons and Dragons character sheet
url: 2016/06/my-onenote-dungeons-and-dragons.html
---

I'm new to Dungeons and Dragons, and only played the 5th edition starter adventure until now. 
So far I'm really enjoying it: the battles, the roleplaying, the characters, the story; 
but I've to admit that keeping notes and updating the character info on paper is annoying sometimes.

<!--more-->

I'm the one keeping the adventure's notes and the party loot as well. I don't see a problem with that, 
except for a few issues: my handwriting is horrible, I write slowly on paper, and after writing and erasing a few times, 
the paper starts refusing to be written on again. Then I decided to go digital.

My first idea was to continue using a form fillable pdf, but instead of printing it, keeping it on the computer, 
and then use OneNote to well... write notes. But then I decided to try to go full-on 
OneNote and here I am to share the initial results.

Please keep in mind that it's not finished and stylized. As a coworker always says: 
don't optimize something that's not ready yet. After the first session I'll make a few changes, and after that, 
try to make it look more like the Player's Handbook, changing the fonts, tables, and background.

## About

This session has the characters roleplaying info: physical appearance, personality and, ideally, background. 
But I didn't write his story yet so...

## Character Sheet

The page that'll be open most of the time: Abilities, skills, weapons, HP. 
There's also a sub-page with my familiar's info.

## Features and Proficiencies

As you may guess, proficiencies and features. It's great that I can just put the feat description on another page 
and insert a link, like on Minor Conjuration. There are subpages with class and race feats.

## Inventory

Money, equipment, potions, treasure, general loot. Nice that I can add the item's description anywhere, 
like the Dwarven Brandy, or create a subpage and insert a link. The magical weapons each have a subpage.

## Spellbook

For spellcasters, all the info you need when you have to decide what to do: range, area, casting time, 
if it's concentration or not. Subpages for each spell's description, and I'll link them later, maybe.

## Party Loot

As I said before, I keep notes on all the party's loot so we can split our earnings later. 
No print because it's the same as Inventory.

## Curse of Strahd

We'll be starting Curse of Strahd, so I'll write down my campaign notes here. Don't know how I'll organize this yet.

## Next Levels

I'll put a numbered list of what to upgrade each level, so I don't need to keep consulting the PHB all the time. 
I can also plan my future spells, ability points, and feats.
