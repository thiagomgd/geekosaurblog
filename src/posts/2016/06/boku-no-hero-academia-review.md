Spring season is over, and it's time to comment the ones that I enjoyed the most. First of all, 
Boku no Hero Academia (My Hero Academia), one of the most hyped anime of this season.

This is a classic shounen story: a young guy, super-powers, a lot of villains, a school where the young aspiring 
heroes go to train and learn how to save lives and fight evil, and more. But this is not bad, after all, cliches and 
tropes exist for a reason. They help to define a genre and develop a story that will please the audience. 
They're a starting point and not everything that defines an anime or manga.

Boku no Hero have all the main things we want in a shounen, but what makes it great is how it's executed. 
The show has a nice mix of battles, heartfelt moments, and important themes like bullying. It's the story of a 
young underdog that always loved heroes, and after years of frustration, 
he's presented with the opportunity to become the best of them.

But it's not just about Izuku and All Might. It's also a story about his friends, rivals, teachers, 
and his relationship with them. The heroes are relatable, and they make you love or hate them. 
Every fan will have it's favorites, but will end up cheering for all of them. 
That's because they're all special in some way, three-dimensional, not being there just to make up the numbers. 
Of course, with a whole school of super-heroes, not everyone gets a lot of screen time, but when they do, 
they have personality.

The art is quite unique and colorful, feeling maybe a little more than a cartoon instead of an anime. 
The art, animation, voice acting and music do a great job in telling this story in a spectacular way. 
It was a pleasure to watch it every week.

Of my season's watchlist, Boku no Hero Academia was one of the most hyped anime. And, surprisingly for me, 
it didn't just meet the expectations, but exceeded it and made me want to consume more anime and manga. 
It made me revive the days were I was younger, presenting that classic shounen story that we (or I) used to love.
