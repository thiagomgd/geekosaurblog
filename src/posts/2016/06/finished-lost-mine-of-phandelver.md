Last Sunday my group finished the starter set adventure: Lost Mine of Phandelver. 
Only 2 characters survived the whole adventure: Zelda, my High Elf Wizard, and Golleros, a Dwarf Barbarian. 
Also, a new player joined us later.

<!--more-->

Now, we'll go back to the city, to do the ending scene and go on another adventure. 
Probably another player will join us with a ranger character, making it 5 adventurers. 
And we'll start Curse of Strahd :) 
I was thinking about changing my character and playing Pansy Goodbarrel, a Halfling Bard that I've created a few days ago, 
but in the end, I've opted by keep playing with Zelda.

You can check out my Character Sheet [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzbyjB7sLmTJR1FyZkhhSFpZeDQ/view?usp=sharing)
I'm not encumbered because we're assuming that the party is dividing the weight of the loot. 
But anyway, I've got too many staves now, and I think I need to sell at least one of them.

Also, starting next session, I'll be using a digital character sheet made on OneNote. 
The main reason is to be able to make notes about our objectives and party loot in a faster and more organized way - 
I'm too slow when writing on paper, and my handwriting is awful. I'll post my OneNote book here later so you can check it.
