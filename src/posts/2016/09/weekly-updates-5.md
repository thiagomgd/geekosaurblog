Here I'm again, with another _not-so-weekly_ update about what I'm doing!

<!--more-->

## Books

### Finished Reading

I finished reading Shadow Scale (Seraphina #2) and truly enjoyed it. There was a part during the middle of it where 
I wasn't _that much_ hooked up, but after some pages, the book found it's pace again. 
If you didn't read this duology, do it! It has dragons, half-dragons, music and mental powers. Great :D

### New on my shelves

Two books from bookdepository arrived this week: A Cast-Off Coven and Hexes and Hemlines (A Witchcraft Mystery #2 and #3). 
The first one was great (You can read my review [here](http://www.generalfalcon.com/2015/07/book-review-secondhand-spirits-by.html)).

## TV shows

### Outlander

I'm so addicted on Outlander! Started watching it a few days ago and I'm almost finishing the first season. 
But this week I watched only one episode (s01e13 - The Watch). And sadly, my curiosity got the worst of me, and I checked the next 
episodes to see what happens =/ I gave spoilers to myself. WHAT HAVE I DONE????

### Zoo

I'm behind the schedule, and watched season 2, episode 10 (The Yellow Brick Road) with my parents.

### Gilmore Girls

Watched the first 6 episodes from season 3. OMG Rory, what are you doing???


## Anime

I finished ReLIFE! There was only one episode remaining, and I finally watched it. It's soooooo good I want to read the manga. 
But I don't think I'll do it because I already don't have time for all the books/comics/tv shows/anime that I want to watch. 
So, unfortunately, reading any manga is out of question for now.

I also watched this week's episode of Shokugeki No Soma, the only anime of this season that I'm still watching.

### Didn't watch 

Didn't watch Killjoys' finale yet. I'm dropping the show andjust don't know if I want to end the second season now. =/
And for Victoria, I was just too busy reading Shadow Scale during my lunch breaks that I decided to wait a few days more.

## Personal life

Now, Instagram for Windows Mobile has stories. YAY! Follow me at @corgiwho. I promise I don't spam you with endless and 
meaningless posts. Also, my Jazz Big Band had a gig on Thursday!
