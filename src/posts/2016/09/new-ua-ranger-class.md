title: Reviewing the new Ranger class
---

It's no secret that the ranger got the worst reception from the public when D&D 5th edition arrived, especially the Beastmaster. 
It wasn't only weak on battles, but the roleplay was also lacking. 
To make things even worse, the flavor wasn't great: so much that online people refer to  the beasts as either _robots_ or _slaves_. 
But last Monday, a revised (or even new, I daresay) version was posted on Unearthed Arcana, 
which features works that aren't considered final products yet, but are good enough for playing. 
So let's take a look at the new Ranger.

<!--more-->

_Note: This post covers the class features, and it'll be followed by another featuring the Beastmaster Conclave._
_There's also a new Hunter and Deep Stalker ranger, but they don't interest me as much as the Beastmaster._
_Maybe I'll talk about them later, maybe not._

I'll put just the most important info about each feature here, and not copy and paste it entirely.

## Favored Enemy - Level 1

_Choose 1 from beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities or undead. +2 to damage rolls, advantage to track and recall info about them and 1 extra language._

This one is nice. Of course, a pretty obvious choice, in general, is humanoids. 
But depending on the campaign, the other options can be also very useful. 
I think any good DM should advise the player not to choose fey or undead if they aren't going to appear during the campaign. 
It also improves when you level up and get __Greater Favored Enemy__.

## Natural Explorer - Level 1

_Ignore difficult terrain. Advantages and bonuses during travels, for you and your group._
_Don't get lost, get more food and great tracking abilities._
_Advantage on initiative rolls and attacks during your first turn, against a creature that didn't attack yet_

This is one that may (or may not) be too powerful. Until now, I didn't see THAT much of difficult terrain during either battles or travels. 
And depending on the DM and the campaign, they aren't too picky on counting the exact time during travels. But it is really nice to have it.

The advantage on initiative and first attack rolls are really nice. 
Combine that with the __Alert__ feature and you'll always have advantage on your first attack, as a good ranger needs a high DEX.

## Fighting Style - Level 2

_Get a bonus from one: Ranged attacks, AC, Melee attacks, second attack (Two-Weapon Fighting)_

There isn't much to say: see what you want to do and get a little bonus. Good!

## Spellcasting - Level 2

_You can cast spells. yay!_

The spell list is not _impressive_, and you don't have many slots. 
But you can summon things (as is having a beast wasn't enough), get invisible, etc. Maybe I'll cover the spells in the future.

## Primeval Awareness - Level 3

_Communicate with beasts, persuade and get insight about them. Also, sense if your favored enemies are nearby_

A neat and useful RP feature. This makes a Forest Gnome's __Speak with small beasts__ totally meaningless. 
But very valuable for your Stout (or Ghostwise) Halfling Beastmaster.

## Ranger Conclave - Level 3

_The Ranger's subclass/archetype_

![Yes. Now you can have a bear as a companion](http://i.imgur.com/UyhsSdz.jpg)

## Greater Favored Enemy - Level 6

_Choose one extra favored enemy from aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fiends, or giants._ 
_Get the same benefits again, but the bonus is now +4 for both Favored and Greater Favored._ 
_Plus, advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy_

Playing Hoard of the __Dragon__ Queen? Choose dragons. Storm King's Thunder? Go for giants. And then... Profit! 
I liked how it also improves _Favored Enemy_, or else it wouldn't be so useful on later levels. 
But remember that the advantage on saving throws is only for the _Greater_ enemy.

## Fleet of Foot - Level 8

_Dash as a bonus action_

Niiiice (if you aren't mounted on your beast, of course).

## Hide in Plain Sight - Level 10

_Hide and don't move. That causes penalty on Perception checks made by enemies_

That's really strange for two reasons: first, it's not you that has a bonus, 
and it doesn't cause disadvantage to the enemy on THAT check, but it's a -10 penalty for all their checks 
(if they try to detect you) until your next turn. I think my DM will rewrite this to be more standard.

## Vanish - Level 14

_Hide as bonus action and can't be tracked by non-magical means_

That's AWESOME, at least for me. Useful for battle and RP, and combined with _Hide in Plain Sight_, this adds a great flavor to the Ranger.

## Feral Senses - Level 18

_Don't have disadvantage to attack creatures you can't see. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you,_ 
_provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened._

I don't know if this is good enough for 18th level, but at least it makes sense for a Ranger, and it's not too weak.

## Foe Slayer - Level 20

_Add Wisdom bonus to attack OR damage bonus_

Great, but maybe a little bit lackluster for a 20th level feature.

That's all folks! Please leave a comment and tell me what you think about this Ranger rework. 
I want to know if you agree with me on the class' features or not. 
And next, I'll do a proper commentary on the Beastmaster Conclave! That's where things got interesting.
