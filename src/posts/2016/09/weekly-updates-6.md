Let's see what I'm up to!

## Books

I'm still reading A Cast-Off Coven (A Witchcraft Mystery #2) by Juliet Blackwell. And I received a boxed set with the 
first three books in Keeper of the Lost Cities series, by Shannon Messenger. I'm truly excited to start reading the 1st 
as soon as I finish A Cast-Off Coven. You can check my unboxing below.

I also bought a hardcover copy of [A Chain of Thunder by Jeff Shaara](http://www.bookdepository.com/search/advanced?seriesId=260351&a_aid=thiagomgd). 
It's the second book in his Western Theater series, about the American civil war, following A Blaze of Glory. 
The first book was on my list because someone on Reddit recommended to me, as a reading about the American civil war. 
It was at a huge discount, so I bought it anyway, despite being the 2nd book.

## Comic Books

I read [Batgirl vol 3: Mindfields](http://amzn.to/2cZylu7), and it's a shame that I don't have much time to read more comic books. 
There are so many great titles out there. And unfortunately, I need to watch more TV Shows and movies without subtitles to practice my listening skills. 
Anyway, it's a good comic, although not as good as the previous two.

## TV Shows

I watched the first episode of Son of Zorn and enjoyed it. If they don't rely just on jokes about how Zorn tries to fit into society, 
they'll deliver a great show. Van Helsing also premiered this week, but I'll only be able to watch it next Tuesday. 

It's been a while since I watched The Americans, and now I'm going to finish the 4th season and started with episode 10 (Munchkin). 
I also finished the first season of Outlander, and despite taking a short break before watching the last couple episodes, it was awesome. 
Now I can't wait to start the second season, but I guess I'll wait a little bit, 
because I still need to finish Victoria, and Son of Zorn, Van Helsing and Simpsons are here!

And during the weekend, I watched She Was Pretty. She was already watching it, so I started in the middle of it. 
But it was nice, and for a long time, I was wanting to watch a k-drama.

## Anime

Apart from the usual Shokugeki no Soma episode of the week, I started watching Hibike! Euphonium again. 
I had stopped at episode 4 when it was airing, and now I'm at episode 10. I want to catch up and then watch the 2nd 
season as it airs. Also, Shokugeki is really great, and it's a shame that this season only has 13 episodes =/

## Random Things

This week I have two videos to show you. First, Angela Lansbury singing The Beauty and The Beast theme, after 25 of her 
original recording. Beautiful and touching, to say the least.

Second, the Stranger Things kids singing Uptown Funk at the Emmys.

A good weekend to you all!
