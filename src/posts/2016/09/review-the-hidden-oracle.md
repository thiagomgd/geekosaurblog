title: 'Review: The Hidden Oracle (The Trials of Apollo #1)'
---

An egocentric and almighty god turned into a whiny and difficult teenager (_are not all teenagers like this?_)? 
The Hidden Oracle is the first in a new series by Rick Riordan, following The Heroes of Olympus series, 
and a part of The Camp Half-Blood Chronicles. And is it good?

<!--more-->

> How do you punish an immortal? By making him human. After angering his father Zeus, the god Apollo is cast down from Olympus. 
Weak and disoriented, he lands in New York City as a regular teenage boy. Now, without his godly powers, 
the four-thousand-year-old deity must learn to survive in the modern world until he can somehow find a way to regain Zeus’s favor. 
But Apollo has many enemies—gods, monsters, and mortals who would love to see the former Olympian permanently destroyed. 
Apollo needs help, and he can think of only one place to go . . . an enclave of modern demigods known as Camp Half-Blood

After reviewing 
[The Sword of Summer (Magnus Chase and The Gods of Asgard #1)](/post/review-the-sword-of-summer-magnus-chase/),
I need to talk about The Hidden Oracle (The Trials of Apollo #1) the second Rick Riordan's book I ever read. 
It follows Apollo in his quest for Zeus' forgiveness and a chance to go back to Olympus and his adult-god form.

The book is written in a first-person point-of-view, and all the events are described by Apollo's egocentric and selfish's thoughts. 
What means that a lot of times, you see him complaining how he would have done better 
if he was still a god, or how the humans and half-gods are weak. 
But the book also shows that some challenges (_or maybe I say, all of them_) seem terrifying to the young god, as he can't rely on his powers.

> It always disappointed me when mortals put themselves first and failed to see the big picture—the importance of putting me first

Despite all the complains and self-centered thoughts, the book manages to successfully avoid boring the reader with endless rants. 
The result is a pleasant read, as the reader can laugh and shiver as the events unfold.

> I've found that when one us searching for danger, it's never hard to find.

As in The Sword of Summer, the humor plays a huge role in this book's success. 
One detail that I absolutely enjoyed is how each chapter starts with a haiku. 
For me, seems like the ideal choice for the god of music. 
Of course, they're nonsense and you can't understand anything about them without actually reading the chapter.

> A walk through the woods  
Voices driving me bonkers  
I hate spaghetti  

> My bus is in flames  
My son is older than me  
Please, Zeus, make it stop

I found this book to be genuinely entertaining, and I expect to read the following book in this series as they're released, 
pairing them with The Gods of Asgard series.

> Zeus did not answer. He was probably too busy recording my humiliation to share on Snapchat.
