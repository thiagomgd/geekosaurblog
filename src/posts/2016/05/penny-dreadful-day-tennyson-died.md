Ladies and gentlemen, Penny Dreadful is back for another season, and after watching the season premiere, 
I can't help but have high hopes for this season, and feel extremely anxious for the upcoming episodes. 
As usual, I grabbed a beer suited for the colder weather we have now (I live in Brazil), 
turned off the lights and started watching the episode.

Instead of recapping the episode as things happened, I'll write about each character separately.

### Caliban

Last season he set sail, and now he's on a ship stuck in ice. He didn't appear much, 
and this episode doesn't give a clue about what waits for him this season. 
After recalling his past while the crew debated about eating an ill, but still alive, child, 
he just breaks its neck and leaves. 
I think that, after the memories had shown up, he'll start investigating his old life, 
to try to discover if his wife and kid are alive. 
I just hope that he doesn't stay separated from the others the whole season.

### Ethan

He's in New Mexico, and was being taken to be judged, but the train is attacked by guns-for-hire, 
hired by, of course, his father, who probably just wants a cozy, warm and friendly family reunion. Or not. 
I expect to see more of him on the upcoming episodes, especially because of Sir Malcolm.

### Sir Malcolm

After burying Sembene (whyyyyyyy ლ(ಥ Д ಥ )ლ ) he's attacked by a woman and a bunch of black men, 
and saved by what seems to be a Native American, who claims to be a father to Ethan. 
Also, he was exchanging letters with Vanessa. 
(If he's traveling on the African jungles and sh*t, I don't know how Vanessa was able to reply, but anyway).

### Frankenstein

OMFG! He's BFF with Dr. Jekyll!!! I had a BIG ###fangirl### fanboy moment here. 
I loved the book when I was young, and this is one I look forward to reading again 
(and this time, the regular version, not an edition for younger readers). 
Anyway, Dr. Frankenstein received the visit of Dr. Jekyll, who's his best friend from school. 
He tells Jekyll about his studies and its results, about Lilly, and Jekyll says he'll be able to control her. 
Them, he told Victor to go see his research another day, and OMG I NEED TO WATCH THIS NOW.

Vanessa: Here is she! Along with Frankenstein, she's the one with most screen time this episode. 
And it was worth it. Lyle convinces her to make an appointment with an alienist 
(old name for ~~crazy people's doctor~~ psychiatrist), and guess what? 
She's related to Joan Clayton AND her last name is Seward. 
She also meets a taxidermist responsible for a museum and they talk about dangerous scorpions and unloved animals, 
a really great topic for a first date, I guess.

And for last, but not the least: DRACULA IS COMING, guys!

## Considerations

Frankenstein and Jekyll campaign to control or destroy Lily together will make a goddamn fantastic story arc. 
And don't forget about Vanessa, Seward, and Dracula!
