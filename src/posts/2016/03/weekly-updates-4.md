title: 'Weekly Updates #4'
---

It's been a looooooong time since I did a weekly update (I guess it's not weekly), but I'll be __trying__ to start posting it again.

## Movies

I've watched Ginger & Rosa this Saturday with my girlfriend and we both liked it. 
I personally have a soft spot for movies with Elle Fanning, and the photography of this movie is really great. 
The colors they used for each scene, everything seems to be carefully chosen. Recommended!

## TV Shows

I __finally__ finished Fortitude, thanks to my decision on watching finished seasons, 
and to finish some TV shows I've left aside. 
It's GREAT and unfortunately I can't say much why without spoiling everything, 
but if you like a dark mystery set on a small and isolated community, it's for you. You won't be disappointed, I promise.

Also, I watched And Then There Were None, a mini-series based on Agatha Christie's homonymous book. 
It's also dark and violent, and if you haven't read the book, it also surprises you at the end!

In addition to these shows, I also watched episodes of Grimm, Heartland, Be Cool Scooby Doo and Modern Family.

## Books

I'm still reading The Dinosaur Lords, and started The Prisoner: Series 1 (a Big Finish audio drama).

<!-- ## Anime

Beyond this season's anime, I also started watching Rokka no Yuusha, which I did a first impressions post 
[here](http://www.generalfalcon.com/2016/03/first-impressions-rokka-no-yuusha.html). -->
