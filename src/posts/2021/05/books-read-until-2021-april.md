One of my goals for this year is to read more: books, manga, articles, poetry, anything. This is part of something that gets more and more important to me every year as I get older, which is spending time on things that are worth my time. 

I can also play games and watch great shows and movies, of course, but I think reading is a great way for me to focus, and be away from the computer and smartphone.

I haven't read A LOT, by any standards, but is great to be tracking that nonetheless, as if you don't measure, it's harder to know how you are doing.

I knew April didn't go well, but I didn't think it was going to be like that. It's important to note that I wasn't actually tracking manga until the last day of April, so those 3 Ranma 1/2 omnibuses that I read weren't accounted for.

One of the reasons April was so bad is that I was programming at night, doing a script for exporting [Trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv) data, and other things. So it was not like it went to waste, but it's a reminder for me to limit some of my activities, or even in some cases, find faster alternatives. For example: I was going to also export data from Anilist, but in the end, I'll just get their `xml` export and use any online service to convert that to csv or json. Or see if there's any site that will export directly to `csv`.

This year so far I've finished the following books:

- The Word is Murder (started on 2020) ([Review](/post/book-review-the-word-is-murder-by-anthony-horowitz/)) ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36919462-the-word-is-murder))
- False Idols (The Dragon Lords #2) ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38369361-false-idols))
- The Institute ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50892339-the-institute))
- Bad Faith (The Dragon Lords #3) ([Review](/post/finished-the-dragon-lords-books/)) ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37760729-bad-faith))

And the following manga volumes:

- Ranma 1/2: omnibuses 1 to 3 (corresponding to vols. 1 to 6) ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18223762-ranma-1-2-vol-1))
- Mieruko-chan Vol. 1 ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54760327-mieruko-chan-vol-1))

Now I'm currently reading Gods of Jade and Shadow ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49185974-gods-of-jade-and-shadow)), and Mythos ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46228086-mythos)).

I truly believe May is going to be better for reading, as I'm more excited to be reading books and manga than April, and I'll be putting more focus on it. Great to waste less time mindlessly scrolling on Instagram, Reddit and Twitter, or watching people browsing Reddit on Youtube.

Before I go: what are you folks reading? (Anything goes)
