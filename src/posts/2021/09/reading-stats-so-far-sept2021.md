I've been traking how much I'm reading, and below are my hourly totals for each month. So far it's been a rollercoaster, but I hope those last few months of 2021 are going to be better.

Small note on the categories: Books that 'teach' me something are categorized under the *learn* category. These are books about mythoogy, poetry, etc, while for *non-fiction* would be a biography, for example.

|Month   |Total|Fiction|Non-fiction|Learn|Manga|

|January |15:25|13:25  |2:00       |0:00 |0:00 |

|August  |7:13 |2:38   |0:00       |0:00 |4:35 |
|Total   |88:55|62:50  |2:37       |9:50 |13:38|

So far, the only non-fiction book I was reading this year was *H is for Hawk*, which is currently on hold, but I hope I get back to it before the end of the year.
