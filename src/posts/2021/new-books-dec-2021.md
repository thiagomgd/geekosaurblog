As every book lover, I always fail when I think about not buying more books. But at least seems like I have it in some kind of control, having got those mostly on huge sales on Kindle.

Dragonflight and Taranished and Torn I go on paper to read during my trip to (and my stay in) Brazil. I already have Dragonflight on Kindle, but since I was not bringing it here, I decided to get it on paper. Ultimately I decided to bring my Kindle with me, so I'll give it to my mother, but it's alright. Tarnished and Torn is the 5th book in a cozy mystery series, and it'll be a great read for winter time when I'm back home.

Broken is the 3rd book by Jenny Lawson, and considering how much I enjoyed the other 2 (I completely adored Furiously Happy), I got to get this one. And Brief Answers has been on my list since the first time I saw it, and considering it was never on sale on paper, I needed to get it when it got cheaper on Kindle.

I saw Kings of the Wyld be recommended on Daniel Greene's channel, and... a funny fantasy series? Count me in! BTW, if you are looking for some laughs, there's The Dragon Lords series, which [I have a short review here](/post/finished-the-dragon-lords-books/). Sawkill Girls looks like an interesting sapphic horror book (a la Wilder Girls), so I'll give it a try!

{{< myEmbed title="Kings of the Wyld (The Band, #1)" author="Nicholas Eames" url="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30841984-kings-of-the-wyld" image="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1477027207i/30841984.jpg" >}}Clay Cooper and his band were once the best of the best -- the meanest, dirtiest, most feared crew of mercenaries this side of the Heartwyld.

Their glory days long past, the mercs have grown apart and grown old, fat, drunk - or a combination of the three. Then an ex-bandmate turns up at Clay's door with a plea for help. His daughter Rose is trapped in a city besieged by an enemy one hundred thousand strong and hungry for blood. Rescuing Rose is the kind of mission that only the very brave or the very stupid would sign up for.{{< /myEmbed >}}

He’ll follow you home, and he won’t let you sleep.
