Being interested in so many different things and genres is not easy. Paired with some good FOMO, and my to-read/watch lists just keep growing more and more. Still, let's see some books I recently got interested into!

## To Be Read

Saw some reviews praising and recommending this book, and the synopsis sound very interesting.

{% myembed {title:"Last Night at the Telegraph Club", author:"Malinda Lo", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35224992-last-night-at-the-telegraph-club", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1593457992i/35224992.jpg"} %}“That book. It was about two women, and they fell in love with each other.” And then Lily asked the question that had taken root in her, that was even now unfurling its leaves and demanding to be shown the sun: “Have you ever heard of such a thing?”

Seventeen-year-old Lily Hu can’t remember exactly when the question took root, but the answer was in full bloom the moment she and Kathleen Miller walked under the flashing neon sign of a lesbian bar called the Telegraph Club.{% endmyembed %}

## Very Interested

The Hacienda is supposed to be something similar to Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia, which I LOVED. Still not released, but hopefully it's going to be good. Will wait a bit after release to check some reviews, but very interested already.

{% myembed {title:"The Hacienda", author:"Isabel Cañas", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57840571-the-hacienda", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1628794005i/57840571.jpg"} %}
Mexican Gothic meets Rebecca in this debut supernatural suspense novel, set in the aftermath of the Mexican War of Independence, about a remote house, a sinister haunting, and the woman pulled into their clutches...

In the overthrow of the Mexican government, Beatriz’s father is executed and her home destroyed. When handsome Don Rodolfo Solórzano proposes, Beatriz ignores the rumors surrounding his first wife’s sudden demise, choosing instead to seize the security his estate in the countryside provides. She will have her own home again, no matter the cost.{% endmyembed %}

{% myembed {title:"The Inheritance of Orquídea Divina", author:"Zoraida Córdova", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56898076-the-inheritance-of-orqu-dea-divina", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1621011341i/56898076.jpg"} %}The Montoyas are used to a life without explanations. They know better than to ask why the pantry never seems to run low or empty, or why their matriarch won’t ever leave their home in Four Rivers—even for graduations, weddings, or baptisms. But when Orquídea Divina invites them to her funeral and to collect their inheritance, they hope to learn the secrets that she has held onto so tightly their whole lives. Instead, Orquídea is transformed, leaving them with more questions than answers...{% endmyembed %}

## Maybe

Mixed reviews for both The Wilder Girls, but in general people seemed to have enjoyed this one. I might get it, What Big Teeth or Horrid.

{% myembed {title:"Wilder Girls", author:"Rory Power", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42505366-wilder-girls", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544204706i/42505366.jpg"} %}It's been eighteen months since the Raxter School for Girls was put under quarantine. Since the Tox hit and pulled Hetty's life out from under her. \[...\]

But when Byatt goes missing, Hetty will do anything to find her, even if it means breaking quarantine and braving the horrors that lie beyond the fence. And when she does, Hetty learns that there's more to their story, to their life at Raxter, than she could have ever thought true.{% endmyembed %}

{% myembed {title:"What Big Teeth", author:"Rose Szabo", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48560025-what-big-teeth", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1590166168i/48560025.jpg"} %}Eleanor Zarrin has been estranged from her wild family for years. When she flees boarding school after a horrifying incident, she goes to the only place she thinks is safe: the home she left behind. But when she gets there, she struggles to fit in with her monstrous relatives, who prowl the woods around the family estate and read fortunes in the guts of birds.{% endmyembed %}

{% myembed {title:"Horrid", author:"Katrina Leno", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358142-horrid", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1579613001i/50358142.jpg"} %}From the author of You Must Not Miss comes a haunting contemporary horror novel that explores themes of mental illness, rage, and grief, twisted with spine-chilling elements of Stephen King and Agatha Christie.

Following her father's death, Jane North-Robinson and her mom move from sunny California to the dreary, dilapidated old house in Maine where her mother grew up. All they want is a fresh start, but behind North Manor's doors lurks a history that leaves them feeling more alone...and more tormented.{% endmyembed %}

This one is not released yet, but I'm somewhat interested. Let's see how it goes when it's released.

{% myembed {title:"The Book of Living Secrets", author:"Madeleine Roux", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44432638-the-book-of-living-secrets", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1624902039i/44432638.jpg"} %}This story follows two girls who transport themselves into the world of their favorite book only to encounter the sinister alternate reality that awaits them.

No matter how different best friends Adelle and Connie are, one thing they’ve always had in common is their love of a little-known gothic romance novel called Moira. So when the girls are tempted by a mysterious stranger to enter the world of the book, they hardly suspect it will work. But suddenly they are in the world of Moira, living among characters they’ve obsessed about for years.

Except…all is not how they remembered it. The world has been turned upside down: The lavish balls and star-crossed love affairs are now interlaced with unspeakable horrors. The girls realize that something dark is lurking behind their foray into fiction—and they will have to rewrite their own arcs if they hope to escape this nightmare with their lives.{% endmyembed %}
