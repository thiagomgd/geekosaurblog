Let's se what I'm planning on reading for the next month or two!

## Fiction

Currently I'm reading Wool (Silo #1) by Hugh Howey. I've seen it recommended on Youtube and Discord, and the whole trilogy is available on Kindle Unlimited so why not? Besides that, I've seen that Mindhunter is also available. I watched almost all of the TV show, and loved it, so ended up getting interested in the book. _Highly recommend the show on Netflix if you haven't watched yet._

I'll try to read all those books before my trial expires on Feb. 25. I kinda doubt I'll make it, but let's see. Otherwise I can always pay for a month, since those books are more expensive than the monthly fee.


## Non-fiction

I recently bought The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change by Camille Fournier since my manager recommended it for career growth. I've also seen Invent and Wander: The Collected Writings of Jeff Bezos being recommended at work, and this one is available on Kindle Unlimited, so it's on the list!
