This year I decided to invest a bit ore in my record collection and gradually expand it. I've been spending less on Uber Eats, and directing some of that saved money on music. Still, this is not a big list, as I don't pre-order much. Maybe I should? Considering the price usually goes up after release, it's actually a good idea.

### March 26: Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia (The Moonlight Edition) ([amazon link](https://amzn.to/3alGSI1))

I've been listening to Dua Lipa recently and when I saw that there was this new, extended version of the Future Nostalgia album, I quickly grabbed the pre-order. It has an extra disc of content, and the running time is around 1 hour instead of less than 40 min. Also, I like this cover better, and the pre-order for the new edition is cheaper than the current version. Good deal.

Dua Lipa was featured in the [first edition of Geekosaur Weekly](https://geekosaur.com/post/geekosaur_weekly_1/)!

### May 21: London Grammar - Californian Soil ([amazon link](https://amzn.to/2LSj1q6))

I admit I haven't been listening to her a lot, but with a good deal on the pre-order, I had to get it. Her voice and her songs are cool to sit down, and listen on a vinyl record. She was featured in [the second issue of Geekosaur Weekly](https://geekosaur.com/post/geekosaur-weekly-2/) (am I seeing a trend here?).

### June 11: Evangelion Final ([amazon link](https://amzn.to/37fvBqM))

Now THIS is something I had to get. Fifteen-year-old would never imagine I would have this someday. If you are an anime fan and older than 30, I'm sure you heard *Zankoku na Tenshi no Teeze* on every anime karaoke at every con. The cover and the discs are gorgeous, and it's a great soundtrack to enjoy. And the running time is almost 1h:20min.

The video below talks about all 6 variants of the release. The one I've got is the regular pink with black splash.
