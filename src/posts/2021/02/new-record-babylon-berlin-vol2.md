Today I received a new vinyl record: Babylon Berlin Vol. 2. This is the soundtrack for the 3rd season of the show, which is odd, but the first volume contained the OST for the first two seasons.

This is a show that I love, and the soundtrack is wonderful. Also, both volumes are gorgeous, and it's definitely worth for me to have it in my collection. have a look at my "unboxing":

The second one is sang by one of the actors, and I liked both the song and his voice. You can check the lyrics (with translation) [here](https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Woods-of-Birnam/Du-bist-alles/translation/english).

Here you can listen to the [whole OST](https://open.spotify.com/album/44EqvbbLocS6wWZHSItcna).
