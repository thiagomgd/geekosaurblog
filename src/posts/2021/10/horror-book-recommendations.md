October is almost done, and I just realized I never recommended any horror book here. Now, let's do it, in no particular order!

## Books

### The Secret Life Of Laszlo, Count Dracula

This is a seriously, criminally underrated book. I've read it more than 10 years ago, and I'm still mad that I don't know anyone else, besides me and my sister, that read it. Written by a psychiatrist, takes a different approach at telling Dracula's tale: who was the human? How did the blood lust start? How did count Dracula, the human, fall in love with blood?

{% myembed {title:"The Secret Life Of Laszlo, Count Dracula", author:"Roderick Anscombe", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1123376.The_Secret_Life_Of_Laszlo_Count_Dracula", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1271550377i/1123376.jpg"} %}In his mesmerizing fictional debut, psychiatrist Roderick Anscombe creates a stunning reinvention of the classic Dracula myth. In sweeping prose, this epic delves into the fevered mind of a man living two lives--a public healer and a private monster whose tormented psyche draws him into a world of violent emotion, bloodlust, and self-loathing.{% endmyembed %}

### Conan Doyle's Horror Short Stories

Readers are usually familiar with Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes' stories. But he also wrote great horror and supernatual short stories. I've the a compilation back in Brazil (The New Catacomb and other stories), but I guess any compilation would do. Check it our, you might be surprised!

{% myembed {title:"Study in Terror: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Revolutionary…", author:"Arthur Conan Doyle", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23097080-study-in-terror", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409890587i/23097080.jpg"} %}Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is one of those authors whose literary creation is much more famous than the man himself. Those who do know the name Arthur Conan Doyle tend to know him only as the inventor of the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes. This two part anthology showcases his lesser know supernatural works.{% endmyembed %}

### Mexican Gothic

This was definitely one of my favorite books of last year, and many months after, I still want more. It's definitely a more slow-paced read, but it's SO damn intriguing and chilling. I love those 'haunted house' stories, and this one is a very welcome change from the usual ghosts/demons stories. I'm also VERY happy that it's being developed as limited series to Hulu.

{% myembed {title:"Mexican Gothic", author:"Silvia Moreno-Garcia", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53152636-mexican-gothic", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1607462569i/53152636.jpg"} %}After receiving a frantic letter from her newly-wed cousin begging for someone to save her from a mysterious doom, Noemí Taboada heads to High Place, a distant house in the Mexican countryside. She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the region.{% endmyembed %}

## Audio-dramas

How about some full-cast audio dramas?

### Doctor Who: The Chimes of Midnight

I absolutely loved the more scary Doctor Who episodes, and The Chimes of Midnight is a FANTASTIC horror mystery featuring the 8th doctor! It blends Agatha Christie mysteries with the best horror Doctor Who has to offer.

{% myembed {title:"Doctor Who: The Chimes of Midnight", author:"Big Finish", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1014769.Doctor_Who", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327498048i/1014769.jpg"}%}Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house not a creature was stirring... But something must be stirring. Something hidden in the shadows. Something which kills the servants of an old Edwardian mansion in the most brutal and macabre manner possible. Exactly on the chiming of the hour, every hour, as the grandfather clock ticks on towards midnight.{% endmyembed %}

### Dark Shadows: The House of Despair

Dark shadows! Yes, there's the Johnny Depp movie that was not that successful (even though I had fun with it), but there's also the soap opera, AND a series of full cast audio books from Big Finish.

Dark Shadow: The House of Despair is GREAT, and, while a little bit of knowledge about who's who helps, a quick check on wikipedia might be enough, or you can even watch the show!

{% myembed {title:"Dark Shadows: The House of Despair", author:"BigFinish", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6240179-dark-shadows", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388700698i/6240179.jpg"} %}After years of wandering, Quentin Collins is coming home.. But the Collinwood that awaits him is no longer the sanctuary he remembers. As the inhabitants of the town of Collinsport hide in fear from other worldly powers. Quentin vows to unite old friends and reclaim the Collins family stronghold.. The Dark Shadows legend continues in this all-new hour-long audio drama, reuniting the cast of the classic ABC-TV series.{% endmyembed %}

### The Scarifyers: The Nazad Conspiracy

For something a bit more comedic, how about two detectives investigating the occult in 1939 London? The Scarifyers is very fun and entertaining, and a delight to listen to!

{% myembed {title:"The Scarifyers: The Nazad Conspiracy (Scarifyers, #1)", author:"Big Finish", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11505074-the-scarifyers", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1306857065i/11505074.jpg"} %}Ghost story writer Professor Dunning (Terry Molloy) doesn't believe in the supernatural. So he's more than surprised when an invisible winged demon appears in his drawing room.{% endmyembed %}
