Let's talk a bit about what I've been watching!

<!--more-->

### Movies Watched

I've been mostly watching TV shows, but wanted to have a change and go for movies, so this weekend I watched a couple: Groundhog Day and Free Guy.

Groundhog Day is one of those classic _old-ish_ movies that's part of pop culture, but I've never watched it. I was actually specifically looking for 80s/early 90s comedies to watch and saw it was available on Netflix. It's funny, has Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell in it, and it's about being stuck in a time loop in a small town. What's not to love?

Then I ended up getting Disney+ again for a month, and saw that Free Guy was available there, so decided to give it a try. It's about online games like Fornite/Free Fire, and it's nice for a Saturday evening. It's a Ryan Reynolds action comedy so you know what you're getting!

### Ongoing Shows

I started watching Seinfeld just as a way to have something that's not Youtube and... I'm on season 3 already ðŸ˜‚. If you like Friends and other comedies like that, it's great and I definitely recommend.

I also started watching Hotel Del Luna, but stopped at episode 5. I might continue soon, it's just that so far, for some reason, it didn't get me that much hooked.

### Shows/Seasons Finished

Before starting Seinfeld, I've finished two recent seasons: Ted Lasso and Archer. I never expected to love Ted Lasso that much, specially considering I'm not big into sports. But it's SO GOOD! The second season just finished airing, and it was planed to last 3 seasons. Which is good as they know where they are headed instead of just seeing if they can get another season or not.

And Archer's been big on me since IDK... 5 or 6 years ago? I absolutely love it, and I'm glad there's going to be at least one more season in the future. I couldn't find the trailer for season 1, but if you don't mind some spoilers, here's trailer for the newest season :)

Yes, I also watched Squid Game, and Midnight Mass and before that I finished the last season of Jack Whitehall: Travels With My Father.

Midnight Mass is an amazing horror limited-series, from the same people that brought us The Haunting of Hill House. And Travels With My Father is a great travel-comedy show with comedian Jack Whitehall and his father (basically, the title)
