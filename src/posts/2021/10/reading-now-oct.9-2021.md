Recently I've been reading a bit more again. I've got a few books in the past couple months, and had a great time with the ones I've read so far.

<!--more-->

In the last few weeks I read **Black Water Sister** and **Later** and loved both of them!

Then I've started **The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist**, which is a transcription of three presentations Richard P. Feynman made. So far so good, and I should be finishing that one soon.

I was thinking about what to start next for my fiction reading, and like my mind was being read, I've got an email from Indigo with the new releases and staff picks, which included The Lighthouse Witches, a book that just released and OMG, it looks so beautiful and interesting.

Two sisters go missing on a remote Scottish island. Twenty years later, one is found--but she's still the same age as when she disappeared. The secrets of witches have reached across the centuries in this chilling Gothic thriller from the author of the acclaimed The Nesting.

What is the nature of the tension between science and religious faith? Why does uncertainty play such a crucial role in the scientific imagination? Is this really a scientific age?
