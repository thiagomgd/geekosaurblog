Recently I've got a few more records. Let's check them!

I ended up deciding to get _Halsey - If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power_. I never paid too much attention to Halsey before, but was curious, and after listening to her new album, I got hooked. It's great, so I ended up getting it.

Wallows I bought for my wife when we were at Urban Outfitters. She likes that and it was cheap, so it just made sense to get it.

Now, for THAT ONE RECORD I wanted for a long time: _Morphine - Cure for Pain_. A friend of mine introduced me to Morphine years ago, and I immediately fell in love with it. Since it's an older band that it's not that mainstream, the records can go easily over CAD$200 or 400, except for Cure For Pain, which seems to be getting the occasional re-release. I missed it a couple times, but now I finally snatched it. Maybe someday I'll be able to get a brand new _Yes._
