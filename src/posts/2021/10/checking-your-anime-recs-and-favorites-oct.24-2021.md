Let's just talk a little bit about anime and manga titles I've seen being recommended or talked about on the anime blogosphere.

Irina had a very nice list of anime and manga about anime. What's not to love about that? The 2nd position in the list is _Shirobako_, which I love, and still have to watch the movie. _Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken_ is a recent title that also caught my attention when it was airing, but I ended up forgetting about it. Maybe it's time to finally watch it.

Dewbond at Shallow Dives wrote a review of Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid S, which I had to skip some parts as I didn't finish it yet. It's strange to not want to see spoilers, considering I'm almost caught up with the manga. Anyway, this is one of my fav. anime/manga, and you should watch it!

Also, I've seen _Mother of Goddess Dormitory_ being recommended at there and... I'm convinced, I guess? I was interested in it before it aired, but then decided not to start and now, seeing this post, I'm curious again. I admit that there was a specific image caption (and the related image) that convinced me. Can you spot which one? (_tip: it has the word uncensored in it_).
