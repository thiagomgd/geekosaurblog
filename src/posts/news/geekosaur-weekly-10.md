After a couple weeks off, I'm back with another Geekosaur Weekly! This time focused only on updates - no thoughts to share ðŸ˜•.

## Music

Lately I've been listening to a lot of those j-music compilations. Great way to discover new music, and also not worry about choosing a specific artist or album.

## Anime

The spring season is here, but so far I'm only watching My Hero Academia, and a few Great Pretender episodes on Netflix. I'm interested in others, but there's just too many things to watch, that I'll probably wait a few more weeks.

## Games

I learned some Mahjong basics by playing Mahjong Soul. I've developed some interest on it many years ago thanks to Saki (which I never finished), and seeing the game there was an extra incentive to try. Didn't play much, but had some good fun. I just need to learn the end game rules ðŸ˜•

Also, with the indie games sale on Nintendo Switch, I snagged 4 games so far:

- Commander Keen in Keen Dreams: Definitive Edition
- The Darkside Detective
- Katana Zero
- Cosmic Star Heroine

Commander Keen is a really old platformer that I used to play when I was a kid, and I loved it - although I played another game in the series: Commander Keen 4 - Secret of the Oracle.

Right now I'm playing Katana Zero, and I think after that I'm going to play Cosmic Star Heroine

## Personal

Last weekend I went for a walk with my wife to see the cherry blossoms. They are lovely, as always, and it's unfortunate that the pandemic is still strong here so we are not comfortable staying outdoors for hours and having a picnic there.

I also got my first Moderna shot on Monday ðŸ˜„. I'm very happy with that!

Also, I'm still working on exporting and organizing my things, like trakt and anilist lists, my youtube playlist, and etc. I want everything either on Notion (watchlists and readlists) or Raindrop (bookmarks, i.e Youtube links). As I go, I'll share script here, like I did with the [Reddit downloader that I posted last week](https://geekosaur.com/post/automating_downloading_reddit_images/).
