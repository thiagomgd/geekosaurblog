Busy week didn't let me check much online content this week, but at least I kept reading and managed to finish a book today!

## Music

This OST is so god, and so nostalgic to me! It brings me back to the early 2000s when I was making new anime-lover friends, going to my first conventions, and we finally were getting some cool mangas (like Card Captor Sakura) published. One of the first few songs - Groovy - is one of my favs, I think.

## Reading

Today I finished reading Gods of Jade and Shadow by Silvia Moreno-Garcia. I got this one because last year I read Mexican Gothic and it was absolutely fantastic, so I decided to get something else form the same author. I enjoyed it a little bit less than Mexican Gothic (which is a newer book) which is kind of a high bar anyway. I still had fun, and recommend it anyway :)

This week my pre-order of The End Of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking) by Katie Mack arrived. I'm excited to read it, and might start after I finish Mythos by Stephen Fry. She has a cool Twitter profile, and I suggest you to follow her there if you are interested in the Cosmos: [AstroKatie](https://twitter.com/AstroKatie)!

Tomorrow I should also receive another book, The Ones We're Meant To Find, which I'll start reading in place of Gods Of Jade And Shadow - as I'm trying to keep reading a fiction and a non-fiction book at 'the same time'.

## Other

On Thursday May 6th, I completed 2 year working at Indeed, and I'm very happy. Getting that job offer, moving to Vancouver, meeting awesome people that work there, it's been really great!

I also got into the 'Diamond League' on Duolingo, and I hope I can keep slowly but steadily learning German. Can't wait until I can actually read something or interact with people on Twitter in German.

Last week I mentioned that I wanted to try journaling more on Notion. That didn't go that well, but at least I'm keeping up with the daily tweets!
