Wow, last time I wrote this 'newsletter' was April 2022, when I got my Sony a6400. Time definitely flies!

## Music

I just love Poly-Ritmo's Brazilian music mixes, and here's a really cool new one!

## Obsidian

I have started using Obsidian instead of Notion for most things, and this weekend I also officially migrated from using Notion to using Obsidian for my book notes - I mean, I still use GoodReads for status tracking, but now I export everything to markdown files inside my personal Obsidian vault. That seems to be working fine. I'll make a post later on with a couple iOS shortcuts that I use with Obsidian

## Moving from D&D5e  to Pathfinder 2e

One of the big news/focuses now for nerd folks is how badly Wizards of the Coast is screwing up with the new OGL. While I haven't been playing since I moved to Canada, I was meaning to return, but this news also gave me a reason to go with Pathfinder instead.

So, I went out and bought the Pathfinder 2e rulebook - the paperback version, since it's cheaper and more portable. Maybe will also end up getting other books later on. Even though I don't have any group to play right now, it might be an incentive to finally make some friends in the city and also go back to this hobby.

Legal Eagle made a cool video about the lawyer PoV of this issue. But I guess regardless of OGL being necessary or not, and what happens with D&D in the future, it just shows us not to trust WotC, and just go to Paizo or any other publisher for TTRPGs.
