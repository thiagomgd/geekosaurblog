1. **TV**: Still watching **That 70's Show**, but also started the new **Yellowjackets** season with my wife. The first episode was very interesting, and I'm excited for it!
2. **Books**: I started reading *Witchlings*[^witchlings], a middle-grade fantasy about witches. But even though the premise is interesting, I wasn't hooked, and a couple things were bothering me. Then after checking some spoiler-free reviews, I decided to DNF it.
3. Almost started *Durarara!*, but ended up going with *Spellcasting in Silk* by Juliet Blackwell. It's the 7th book in the Witchcraft Mystery series, and it seems this series is a go-to for me when I don't know what to read and am kinda tired. Maybe will read Durarara! after.
	1. This series is my most read cozy-mystery series to date. The 2nd place is the *Magical Cats Mystery*[^magicalCats] series, which I read 5 books.
4. I kinda want to read more cozy mysteries. Maybe I'll return to some other series I've started in the past, or even start a new one? Spell Booked[^retiredWitches] seems interesting.
5. **Manga**: Read a bunch of Nagatoro volumes (4 through 8). I'll probably catch up to it before moving on to something else. So far it's been fun.
6. It also kinda got me wanting to read more manga and light novels/watch more anime. Let's see what happens.
7. **Music**: I created a new Instagram account just to follow music profiles. Since I started seeing a bunch of ads and suggestions for bands/singers, it seems like a good idea. Let's see if I discover new cool things.
