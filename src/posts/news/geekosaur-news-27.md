Back again to talk about random things and some personal updates!

## Book Recs

I discovered this Youtube channel this week, and this video has some pretty cool recs for! I definitely want to read a bit more sci-fi (soft or hard, young/middle grade or adult), and also some sapphic stories. So this list is pretty good for me.

I added City of Shattered Light to my list!

## Got a Kobo

On the last news ([#26](/posts/geekosaur-news-26)), I mentioned that I was going to migrate to Kobo, but maybe not buy it yet. _Of course I bought it_.

I had points on Indigo's rewards program, and they were running a 'your points are worth more' promotion last weekend. That plus the Kobo Libra 2 being on sale (CAD$20 off), it was just too good of an opportunity to pass on.

Already got a couple books at the library - the 2 I'm currently reading. Also added a few holds, and saw that they have a bunch of the Dresden Files books. The library is going to make me save all the device's money in a while.

## News

### Ruined Childhood Cinematic Universe

So, you probably hear there's a Winnie The Pooh horror movie that just came out, and there's a Peter Pan in the works, and also Bambi is in planning? Now, seems this is all being planned as a cinematic universe that's all about turning our childhoods into nightmare fuel.

I'm not a big fan of slasher horror, but I guess I wanna check it out? At least the Peter Pan one.

> Already on the docket: an adaptation of Peter Pan that finds the spritely Tinkerbell in recovery fromÂ drugs even harder than applause.

### Zootopia 2

This definitely made my day today. It took me years to finally watch Zootopia - so I definitely missed all the online buzz. But when I did finally watch it back in March 2021, I just LOVED IT so much!

It'll definitely be fun to return to this world, and this time, participate in the online buzz/discussions around it, see fanart, cosplays, etc.
