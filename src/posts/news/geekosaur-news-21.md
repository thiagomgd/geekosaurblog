It’s been a long time since the last Geekosaur News - our ~~weekly~~ very infrequent and occasional newsletter. But this time, let’s talk a bit about games!


## New games for me


This weekend I got two games for the Nintendo Switch: Triangle Strategy and Mario Kart 8.


Triangle Strategy is a tactical jrpg that looks so cool! Aside from the graphics, it’s a story focused game, with about 20 chapters, and one battle on each chapter (plus training battles you can do as you progress). 


That’s a big plus for me, since I have some difficulty with rpgs where you just keep getting random battles every 2 minutes and can’t progress on the story. It’s also cool that it’s a tactical one!


And since there was a Mario sale this weekend, my wife was interested in getting Mario Kart so we could eventually play a little bit together. I guess it’s not something we will be playing a lot, but it’s nice to have it available.


## News and discussions


Talking about kart games, I was interested in Chocobo GP, since I used to play Chocobo Racing on my PS1 when I was a kid. Unfortunately, it ended up being a full priced game that’s behaves like a mobile game in terms of getting you to pay for everything. It’s such a turn-off, but I guess it happens nowadays. And that’s one of the reasons I avoid preordering games. ([reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/tduz50/psa_do_not_buy_chocobo_gp_for_your_children/))


I was watching the video below on big releases for the Switch this year, and one of the things that he says is that there’s a lot of tactical RPGs. Not that I’m complaining, of course :)

I know I’m not going to be playing many games anyway, but I would say I’m interested at least in Digimon Survive and Metal Slug Tactics. Although I loved Advance Wars, I’m not a big fan of the new visuals :/. Really prefer the 2d/anime style.


BTW, Digimon Survive seems very promising. I hope it’s a great game!
