I'm here again with another Geekosaur Weekly! This is a shorter edition, due to a very busy week, and some elbow and wrist pain today. But there's still good things to check here, so keep reading!

## Music

Today we have some bluegrass with Aoife O'Donovan, Sarah Jarosz and Sara Watkins. I'm was only familiar with Sarah Jarosz, but I think this trio presentation was quite nice! Good vibes and relaxing for the weekend.

## Article: ‘A Perfect World’ Around Every Miniature Bend

The NY Times has a nice article about miniature trains, which it very worth having a look: [link here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/business/model-trains-pandemic.html). I don't have the patience, steady hand and creativity necessary to do anything regarding model trains/ships/figures. But I do like to look at it! That reminds me a bit of an episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine where Holt and Terry are arguing what is better wen building those maps: focusing on realism or fun. I'd say both are nice!

Even better than the article, is this 5 min video that shows a German model railway. It has SO much cool things.

There's also a great article about Miniatur Wonderland here: [link here](https://ecobnb.com/blog/2019/08/miniatur-wunderland-journey-miniature-world/).

## Watching

I continue watching Star vs the Forces of Evil, but I also started watching Sex Education on Netflix, and I'm already midway through season 2. I have watched the last 3 episodes (of season 2) with my wife a year or so ago, and it was pretty fun and binge-able.

That's it for today! I hope you enjoyed this shorter edition and wish everyone a great week(end).
