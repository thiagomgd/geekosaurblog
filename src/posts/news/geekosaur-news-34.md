## Back From Vacation

I'm back from vacation, and back to a more normal routine - before our trip, my wife and I were busy with preparations and other stuff. Now we have a huge amount of pictures to go through and maybe post on our instagrams (I'm posting some street photography on [@geekosaur_photo](https://www.instagram.com/geekosaur_photo/)).

## Buying K-Pop Albums

On the trip, I bought 3 k-pop albums: IU's 5th Album 'Lilac' ([HILAC Version](https://www.discogs.com/release/18048907-IU-IU-5th-Album-Lilac)), Taeyeon's Purpose ([beige version](https://www.discogs.com/release/14814638-%ED%83%9C%EC%97%B0-Purpose)) and Red Velvet's [The Red Summer](https://www.discogs.com/release/10792415-Red-Velvet-The-Red-Summer-). (*should have bought more, but I wasn't sure it was going to fit in our luggage*)

Then, after we returned, I ended up buying Le Sserafim's Unforgiven ([Dewy Sage version](https://www.discogs.com/release/27050652-Le-Sserafim-Unforgiven)). I almost bought GFriends' Song of The Sirens, but they didn't have the [Broken Room](https://www.discogs.com/release/15659685-GFriend-%E5%9B%9ESong-Of-The-Sirens) version, which I liked the photobook more.

I posted a couple unboxing videos on my TikTok (that's the only thing I posted so far there): [Red Velvet](https://www.tiktok.com/@falconsensei/video/7234678842500140294), [Taeyeon](https://www.tiktok.com/@falconsensei/video/7235421808084667654).

## Language Learning

During our trip, I ended up deciding to stop studying German, and to start Korean instead. Already wanted to learn it so long ago, and I think it's going to be more useful in the shorter/medium term.

Also, harder for me to integrate German in my day-to-day, since there's not a lot of shows/comics/news/etc that I could keep in touch with the culture. While for Korean, I do enjoy the dramas, k-pop, and follow some idols on Instagram, etc, and am more interested in food/general culture

## TV

My wife and I watched **American Born Chinese** on Disney+, and we enjoyed it! We are also back to watching **From** on Paramount+ and it continues to be great!!! **Yellowjackets** on the other hand has being feeling more like a chore... we didn't even watch the season finale yet - it aired this past weekend.

![Me, full of excitement with Yellowjackets|American Born Chinese Actress Making Disappointed Face](https://64.media.tumblr.com/24b5039d6071372edf339210da80756b/d645a7e852fc7de2-87/s400x600/3a622a0da6be0401ceadefb6a3ceaa3e53243f24.gif)

By myself, I'm watching Signal, a Korean drama that I watched the first episode a few years ago but ended up not following through at that moment. Not I'm halfway through and enjoying it a lot!

## Music

I've been listening to a bit more k-pop recently. Today I was checking [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf1dXoG9K-avMOWZPaNjFzWhPttAKLWzR) by G Nitro on Youtube. I'm dumping some that I liked below!
