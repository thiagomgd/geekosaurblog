Very busy end of year, but at least I got time for some quick updates and thoughts!

## Thoughts And News

1. The new Fantastic Beasts has a trailer and it shows Mads Mikkelsen as Grindelwald. It looks cool, and I'm not gonna shit on Mads, but I just can't get behind that movie anymore after Depp was fired, Amber is still in Aquaman, and J. K. Rowling is still being openly transphobic... it's a shame.
2. One Piece (actually Toei Animation) also had [some problems with content creators](https://twitter.com/DanielBGreene/status/1468768666435133442). In the end, Youtubers might stop making videos about One Piece, which is a shame for the fans, but totally understandable. Daniel Greene has a [nice video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_OSm-wPLqA).
3. If you use the term Latinx, [you can stop now](https://twitter.com/politicalsock/status/1467876331203530762). Seems I'm not alone in hating it, and most actual Latinos don't like it either.
4. I was wondering about adding comments to this blog. Unfortunately there's no good cheap/free alternative to Disqus. Maybe I'll either keep it without comments, add email form, or a hidden Disqus section that only loads when the user clicks a button. Let's see...

## Currently Reading/Watching

I saw some recommendations for the Silo series by Hugh Howey, so I decided to give it a try. It's a trilogy and all books are available on Kindle Unlimited - at least in Canada. So I signed up for a 3 month trial and so far I'm enjoying it a lot. I'm around 25% of the first book.

{% myembed {title:"Wool (Silo #1)", author:"Hugh Howey", url:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus", image:"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1632015866i/59023378.jpg"} %}The world outside has grown toxic, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. The remnants of humanity live underground in a single silo. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they want: They are allowed to go outside.{% endmyembed %}

As for watching, I was watching Everybody Loves Raymond a lot with my wife. But now that I'm in Brazil for the Holidays, I started a couple anime: Tawawa on Monday and Mother of the Goddessâ€™ Dormitory. Yeah, only ecchi for now
