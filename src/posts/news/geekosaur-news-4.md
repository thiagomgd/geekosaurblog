Another weekly updates, thoughts, music and internet things!

### Music

This weekend let's groove to some Hayley Williams, Paramore's singer who is doing some great songs in her solo career.

### Watching

My wife started watching Start-Up, a Korean drama that ended recently, and it's available on Netflix. I've bee watching most of it with her, and seems entertaining enough.

I'm not watching it yet, but Sisyphus: The Myth premiered on Netflix, with weekly episodes (2 per week). Im going to wait a bit, as I don't do that well with ongoing shows. The drama has Park Shin-hye in it (The Call, Memories of Alhambra, Pinocchio), so of course I'm going to give it a try.

### Reading

This week I started the last book in the The Dragon Lords trilogy by Jon Hollins ([Goodreads Link](https://www.goodreads.com/series/181705-the-dragon-lords)). But I didn't read much, barely 1 hour. Probably compensating that last week I read a lot every day.

On the bright side, I read a little bit of Fire Force, a manga that I stopped a couple months ago. Lets see if I can make more time for manga starting from now.

### Thought: What's regret?

The profile Aliens About Humans has an interesting explanation about regret. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Regret is a human mental process entirely dedicated to assessing the possible outcomes from options that are no longer available.</p>&mdash; Aliens About Humans (@HumansExplained) <a href="https://twitter.com/HumansExplained/status/1361373449919356929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Ditching RSS feeds for emails

This week I saw this link and discussion on Hacker News: [Kill the Newsletter â€“ Convert email newsletters into Atom feeds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26167248). There's a nice discussion of people going both ways: from RSS to email and from email to RSS. In the end, I decided to start switching from RSS to email.

The reasons are kinda simple:

1. I forget to check my Feedly. Email is on my email, so as long as I create filters to put tem on a separate folder (easy by using *myemail+blogs@domain.com*), everything will be neatly organized;
2. Less limiting for me: with Feedly, any features are only available for paid users. To be fair, I don't need so many fancy things, but one thing that definitely makes a difference is that article only stay there for 30 days. While it's true that I will probably not read articles that I didn't read in 30 days, having it permanently in my inbox is less pressure.

Of course, I miss some good displaying for the articles, with featured images, but still, I think this might be good in the end.

### Internet

John Spencer and Nabe-chan posted some cool anime bingos on Twitter. I didn't complete them though. Am I a normie?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/anime?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#anime</a>&quot; fans, I bet NONE of you can get a BINGO on THIS card.<br><br>Tweet using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotANormie?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NotANormie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JS_Reviews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JS_Reviews</a> if you can get at least one. <a href="https://t.co/n0ApDlRQ22">pic.twitter.com/n0ApDlRQ22</a></p>&mdash; Jon Spencer Reviews (@JS_Reviews) <a href="https://twitter.com/JS_Reviews/status/1362891009122705410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We also got to see Emma Stone as Cruella De Vil! I'm excited for it and I hope it's good, as 101 Dalmatians was part of my childhood and I loved both live and animated versions.
