## Moving From Kindle To Kobo

I made a decision to migrate from Kindle to Kobo. While I'm probably not going to buy a Kobo right now (I shouldn't, right?), I decided that I won't be buying any new Kindle books.

It's not like I should buy any more books anyway, but you know how it is: you see a cool title on sale, and end up getting it. But that means 100s of books in my Kindle library that I haven't read yet, and probably never will.
