## Moving From Kindle To Kobo

I made a decision to migrate from Kindle to Kobo. While I'm probably not going to buy a Kobo right now (I shouldn't, right?), I decided that I won't be buying any new Kindle books.

It's not like I should buy any more books anyway, but you know how it is: you see a cool title on sale, and end up getting it. But that means 100s of books in my Kindle library that I haven't read yet, and probably never will.

So I guess it's good to switch to Kobo, try to get most stuff from the library, and be mindful of spending way too much in books I'm not 100% certain I'll be reading anytime soon.

Since the Kobo website is really not that good for keeping a wishlist - I know, I shouldn't be creating the list anyway - I created my own wishlist here on the blog: [Kobo Wishlist](https://geekosaur.com/wishlist/). This is basically a personal list that is updated with a script that scrapes the prices from Kobo and sorts it by price, and flags if something is available on Kobo+.

I guess after I actually buy a Kobo, I should go and keep a wishlist on my library instead.

## Watching Now: Lockwood & Co

This weekend I started watching Lockwood & Co with my wife, and we are both enjoying it. Someone recommended the books to me a while ago, but I ended up leaving it for later and now I went with the show. With only 2 more episodes to go, I'd say it's recommended :D 

## Random / Fun Things

You've made it this far, so let's see some random things!

The Boys was more popular than Marvel shows. I like that! Still need to watch the latest season, though.

> I hate the misconception that introverts don’t like talking. If you’re the right person, we’ll talk to you for hours on end about pretty much anything. However, it’s incredibly difficult to find the right people, so for the most part we’ll probably just stay quiet
