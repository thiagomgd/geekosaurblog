Time for another Geekosaur Weekly, were I share some news, thoughts and random links.

## Thoughts and News

1. River City Girls 2 is coming in 2022 and there's a [new trailer on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WayForward/status/1471179503334576129)!! I'm very excited for it (_even though I still need to finish the first game_)
2. Also, seems like [Gex might be back](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2021/12/18/gex-trademark-filed/)? I remember playing Gex: Enter the Gecko on my PS1, and it was pretty cool.
3. For those that don' get the hate on NFTs, there are some short explanations [here](https://twitter.com/emilyhiggs24/status/1471662482758455301). Yeah, it's pretty bad.
4. There's a nice post on Animated Observations on seasonal anime: [No, You Don’t Have To Watch Everything](https://animatedobservations.com/2021/12/17/no-you-dont-have-to-watch-everything/).
5. Since I'm on the 3 month Kindle Unlimited trial, I decided to create a bookmarklet to help me see which books on my Amazon wishlist are eligible. [Check it here](https://gist.github.com/thiagomgd/b1c7331cdc04e02ec1b17e9a2c6eb14f).
6. I'm thinking about possibly migrating this blog from Hugo to Eleventy. Maybe that'll be what I will be doing after I'm back home mid-January ([tweet](https://twitter.com/FalconSensei/status/1471926864746795017))
