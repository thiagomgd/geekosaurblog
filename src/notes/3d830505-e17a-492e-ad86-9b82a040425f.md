> These days people want to improve overnight, so when they hear they have to dedicate a year before achieving results, they get scared.  
> Little do they know: if they practice without technique, they will get further and further away from achieving good results. By the time they reach old age, they have failed to learn anything.  
> If you use proper technique to practice, you can actually count the days that it takes to improve. After a year you will have reached a high level of shooting.  
> How is this not a shortcut?
