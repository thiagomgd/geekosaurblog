Yesterday I received the OST for The Serpent, a show I enjoyed a lot and that has a great soundtrack. My wife and I binged the show, and I listened to the soundtrack during most of the time I was reading [The Lighthouse Witches](https://geekosaur.com/post/the-lighthouse-witches-book-notes/).

I pre-ordered it a long time ago and the release was postponed so many times I though I was not going to get it anymore. But I’m happy it’s here now. And it looks BEAUTIFUL!

You can see the trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgB7rMuxY-s) and listen to the soundtrack [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgJeWP_vw8M&list=PLuF78wm0RiGZlDiRBcCa06LCQLBC4T938).
