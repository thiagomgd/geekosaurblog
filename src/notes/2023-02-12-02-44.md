After a couple weekends, I finally managed to catch up with Black Clover. I originally stopped on the 6-month training hiatus a couple years ago, and they decided to finally catch up to it so now I can read it as published until it ends.

It's been a lot of fun! It's a shame the manga is not more popular. If you haven't given it a chance yet, try it :) 

Now I guess I have to decide what to read next. Either catch up with Kaiju no. 8, finish Fire Force, read the next One Piece's story arc, or something else - maybe start a new title? Let's see what I'm in the mood for in the coming days.
