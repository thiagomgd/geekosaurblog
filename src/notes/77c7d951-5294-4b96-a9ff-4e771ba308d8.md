Today I saw a post titled How To Use Twitter, which has some interesting thoughts on how to improve the Twitter experience. And I guess the most important thing is not using the main timeline, but instead relying on the lists feature.

It’s really a letdown that to have a good experience on the platform we should avoid the main user experience they are offering, but I guess that’s the only way of really avoiding so many suggestions, likes and topics.

It’s still doesn’t solve my gripe with having my likes to myself, but that’s maybe ok for now.

This HackerNews comment (and following thread) also gives some indication that yeah, trying to mark those suggestions as ‘not interested’ is not gonna help in the long run, but just make Twitter suggest worse content every time [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30271837](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30271837)
