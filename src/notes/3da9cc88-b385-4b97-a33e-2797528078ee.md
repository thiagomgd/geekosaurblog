Just saw that Audible is giving 3 months for free, so I had to go in and grab The Mapmaker (Cordelia Hatmaker #2), written and narrated by Tamzin Merchant!

I still have to finish listening to the first volume (Iâ€™m terrible with audiobooks), but Iâ€™m sure I was going to get it someday anyway. And maybe Iâ€™ll get both books either in print or e-Book so I can read along ðŸ™‚
