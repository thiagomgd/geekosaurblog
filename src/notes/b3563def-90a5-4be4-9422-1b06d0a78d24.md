My first 10 weeks of this year (up to last week). It’s not A LOT, but it’s good enough for me!

A few notes on the weeks I have a lot of pages/chapters:

For books, I read a lot more when I was reading the first 2 books in the Silo trilogy (still need to read #3), and Sawkill Girls.

For manga, the 102 chapters week was basically Sakamoto Days + Kaiju No. 8. About 50 chapters each. And then last week I read a few Gal Gohan volumes and some One Punch Man!
