This Saturday night I was listening to some songs that reminded me of my bands back in Brazil. Since I don’t use Spotify anymore and have migrated to Youtube Music, I decided to recreate my playlists there.

I never finished those playlists on Spotify, so I’ll see if someday I find the setlists so I can have complete playlists there. I also want to create setlist for other bands I’ve played with, and also my big band. But that’s for another time. They are both below:

- [Trivial](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZIaVOUaxLAOpQvzJCeugpYgRpPlnA8m2&feature=share)
- [The Mad Mavericks](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZIaVOUaxLAP7EK8JjXvc3FpWoM-LUVlI&feature=share)
