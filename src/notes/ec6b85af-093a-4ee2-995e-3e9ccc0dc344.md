Today work wasnâ€™t being very productive, but my wife and I decided to go to an early dinner on a sushi place nearby that we like. We had smoked salmon, mango and some veggie gyozas, along with Asahi beer and tea.

On our way back, a quick stop at Nordstrom to walk around a bit, and then, when arriving home, a beautiful and smiling samoyed was sniffing me, and after I continued walking, he (or she? seemed like a male) kept looking at me instead of walking. THAT WAS SO CUTE!!! Even the owner was like... what?

Now, time for a bit of What We Do In The Shadows, maybe start playing the Triangle Strategy demo or read One Punch Man.
