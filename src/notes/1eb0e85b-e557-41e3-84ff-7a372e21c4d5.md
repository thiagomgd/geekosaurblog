This is how my year has been so far regarding reading. I read way more after I arrived back in Vancouver and was reading Shift, the second book in the Silo trilogy.

Also, yesterday I finished [Broken](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54305363-broken) by Jenny Lawson, and it’s very good. And now I need to find something else to read. Maybe Sawkill Girls? Or more nonfiction? I’ll decide soon, I guess!
