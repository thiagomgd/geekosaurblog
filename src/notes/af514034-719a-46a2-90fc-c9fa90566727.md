Today I was chatting with work folks, and we talked a bit about speed reading. One of my co-workers is starting to study a bit more about it, which reminded me that I also should be looking into it. There’s just so much to learn, and being faster/better at it definitely helps.

We also talked a little bit about memory, as I was remembering Moonwalking With Einstein - that I still need to finish.

We also talked about Notion and Obsidian, and I’m looking into Obsidian, to have those evergreen notes that are linked and have a connection graph :) 

I will still keep notion for blog, books, and a lot else though. All that I use as database, and not notes.

Below is a part of Moonwalking With Einstein where he talks about the poetry step on the memory competitions.
