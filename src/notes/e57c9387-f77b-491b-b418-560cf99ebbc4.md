After a long time, Iâ€™m continuing reading One Punch Man. I read the first 47 chapters in 2020 and then stopped, but I guess now I was in the mood for it again, after reading about 50 chapters of Sakamoto Days and Kaiju No. 8.

And now I finally saw the monster that was showing up on my Twitter feed when she debuted on the manga.
