As per my reading goals for April, I started reading The Courage To Be Disliked by by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga. 

I don’t usually read self-help, but this one seems cool, and is very psychology and philosophy oriented. One interesting thing about it is that it’s written as a conversation between someone and a philosopher.

I just finished the first chapter - about 30 pages in - and so far I’m enjoying it.
