After catching up with Black Clover, I'm back to reading Ranma 1/2. Read a couple of the double volumes, and already started another one. Have also been checking the Manga Plus app to see what else is there. 

Yeah, I know, shouldn't be doing that considering how many I'm already "currently reading", or already have in my list. But, if anyone has a suggestion of a manga that's on Manga Plus and NOT on Shonen Jump app, let me know :)

Also, updated my [currently reading page](https://geekosaur.com/currentlyReading/) with a few manga I'm interested in maybe starting later this year:

- My Monster Secret / Jitsu wa Watashi wa
	- Watched the anime years ago and it was fun. Wanna see the whole story
- Call Of The Night
	- Anime was fun, BUT will probably end up just waiting for season 2 instead
- Ayakashi Triangle
	- Interested in the anime too, but haven't been watching anime recently
- Grand Blue
	- Read first few chapters a loooooong time ago
- My Hero Academia
	- Since manga is ending, wanted to maybe read it along as it releases. Watched only a couple episodes of the current season, and stopped watching any anime at the moment
- Kaguya-sama: Love Is War
	- The anime didn't catch my attention, I think I don't even finished the first episode. But I wonder if I should give the manga a try
