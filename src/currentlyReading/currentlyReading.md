	- Anime was fun, BUT will probably end up just waiting for season 2 instead
- Ayakashi Triangle
	- Interested in the anime too, but haven't been watching anime recently
- Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible
	- Also not sure if I watch or read this one
- Grand Blue
	- Read first few chapters a loooooong time ago
- My Hero Academia
	- Since manga is ending, wanted to maybe read it along as it releases. Watched only a couple episodes of the current season, and stopped watching any anime at the moment
