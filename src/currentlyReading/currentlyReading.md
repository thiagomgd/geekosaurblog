### Want To Start

- My Monster Secret / Jitsu wa Watashi wa
	- Watched the anime years ago and it was fun. Wanna see the whole story
- Call Of The Night
	- Anime was fun, BUT will probably end up just waiting for season 2 instead
- Ayakashi Triangle
	- Interested in the anime too, but haven't been watching anime recently
- Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible
	- Also not sure if I watch or read this one
- Grand Blue
	- Read first few chapters a loooooong time ago
- My Hero Academia
	- Since manga is ending, wanted to maybe read it along as it releases. Watched only a couple episodes of the current season, and stopped watching any anime at the moment
- Kaguya-sama: Love Is War
	- The anime didn't catch my attention, I think I don't even finished the first episode. But I wonder if I should give the manga a try

### Paused / On Hold

- Would probably need to restart from zero:
	- Sailor Moon
	- Video Girl Ai
	- Card Captor Sakura: Clear Card Arc
- Bungo Stray Dogs
- New Game
- We Never Learn
- Air Gear
- Oh! My Goddess
- Yuuna And The Haunted Hot Springs
-
